 abstract = {Recurrent pain is a common experience in childhood and adolescence and can result in significant disability in youth, including poor quality of life, school absences, and reduced social activities. Evidence has linked adolescent risk and resilience factors with treatment outcomes. However, less research has focused on examining risk and resilience factors that may influence or predict adolescents' compliance to treatment within an interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain management program. Participants included 64 adolescents (M = 15.00 $\pm$ 1.69 years); 85.9{\%} female, 84.4{\%} Caucasian who presented to an initial evaluation in an interdisciplinary pediatric pain management program with their caregiver. Youth completed a series of questionnaires at the initial evaluation targeting pain acceptance, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, parental responses, pain intensity, and functional disability. Treatment compliance was measured at 3 and 6 months post-intake. Findings indicated that higher levels of adolescent-reported self-efficacy predict decreased treatment session attendance, whereas lower levels of acceptance and parental encouragement/monitoring of symptoms predict increased treatment compliance overall. Several adolescent-reported risk factors were associated with increased functional impairment among this sample. Results highlight the unique importance of risk and resilience factors within the developmental context of adolescence, while also emphasizing the need for further investigation of other relevant influences towards treatment compliance and functional impairment.},

Systematic and explicit methods of making judgments can reduce errors and improve communication. We have developed a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts. In this article we present a summary of our approach from the perspective of a guideline user. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation require consideration of the balance between benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence, translation of the evidence into specific circumstances, and the certainty of the baseline risk. It is also important to consider costs (resource utilisation) before making a recommendation. Inconsistencies among systems for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations reduce their potential to facilitate critical appraisal and improve communication of these judgments. Our system for guiding these complex judgments balances the need for simplicity with the need for full and transparent consideration of all important issues.},

 abstract = {Repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique for determining the common within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals. Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results are fully reproducible.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Joint hypermobility is common in childhood and can be associated with musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction. Current management is delivered by a multidisciplinary team, but evidence of effectiveness is limited. This clinical trial aimed to determine whether a structured multidisciplinary, multisite intervention resulted in improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care.

METHOD

A prospective randomised, single centre parallel group trial comparing an 8-week individualised multidisciplinary intervention programme (bespoke physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the clinical, home and school environment) with current standard management (advice, information and therapy referral if deemed necessary). The primary endpoint of the study was between group difference in child reported pain from baseline to 12 months as assessed using the Wong Baker faces pain scale. Secondary endpoints were parent reported pain (100 mm visual analogue scale), parent reported function (child health assessment questionnaire), child reported quality of life (child health utility 9-dimensional assessment), coordination (movement assessment battery for children version 2) and grip strength (handheld dynamometer).

RESULTS

119 children aged 5 to 16 years, with symptomatic hypermobility were randomised to receive an individualised multidisciplinary intervention (I) (n~= 59) or standard management (S) (n~= 60). Of these, 105 completed follow up at 12 months. No additional significant benefit could be shown from the intervention compared to standard management. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in child and parent reported pain, coordination and grip strength in both groups. The response was independent of the degree of hypermobility.

CONCLUSION

This is the first randomised controlled trial to compare a structured multidisciplinary, multisite intervention with standard care in symptomatic childhood hypermobility. For the majority, the provision of education and positive interventions aimed at promoting healthy exercise and self-management was associated with significant benefit without the need for more complex interventions.

TRIAL REGISTRATION

The trial was registered prospectively with the national database at the Clinical Research Network (UKCRN Portfolio 9366). The trial was registered retrospectively with ISRCTN ( ISRCTN86573140 ).},

@article{Banez.2014,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

The purpose of this research was to describe 24-42 month outcomes of a combined inpatient/day hospital interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program for children and adolescents with chronic pain and functional disability.

METHODS

One-hundred-seventy-three children and adolescents (mean age=15.1 years, SD=2.5) were treated in the three-week program. Mixed effects regression models (MERM) examined changes over time in pain ratings (0-10), school days missed by children and work days missed by parents in the preceding week, and the number of days hospitalized in the preceding month.

RESULTS

Participants reported a significant decline in pain from admission to 24-42 month follow-up. The largest declines in pain occurred from discharge to 1-month follow-up (6.20 vs. 4.81 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale) and from 12 months to 24-42 month follow-up (4.90 vs. 3.56). Two distinct trajectories of treatment response were identified using growth mixture modeling: children with initially high pain ratings exhibited large reductions in pain ratings, while those with lower pain ratings at admission showed minimal reductions. Treatment resulted in significant reductions in school and work days missed and the number of days hospitalized (all p's {\textless} 0.001), with reductions evident at 1-month follow-up and maintained through 24-42 month follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation is a promising approach to chronic pain and associated disability in children, with enduring improvements found 24-42 months following program completion. Distinct trajectories of treatment response were identified.},

@article{Basagana.2013,
 abstract = {Multiple imputation is a common technique for dealing with missing values and is mostly applied in regression settings. Its application in cluster analysis problems, where the main objective is to classify individuals into homogenous groups, involves several difficulties which are not well characterized in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a framework for applying multiple imputation to cluster analysis when the original data contain missing values. The proposed framework incorporates the selection of the final number of clusters and a variable reduction procedure, which may be needed in data sets where the ratio of the number of persons to the number of variables is small. We suggest some ways to report how the uncertainty due to multiple imputation of missing data affects the cluster analysis outcomes-namely the final number of clusters, the results of a variable selection procedure (if applied), and the assignment of individuals to clusters. The proposed framework is illustrated with data from the Phenotype and Course of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (PAC-COPD) Study (Spain, 2004-2008), which aimed to classify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease into different disease subtypes.},

@article{Baujat.2002,
 abstract = {Heterogeneity can be a major component of meta-analyses and by virtue of that fact warrants investigation. Classic analysis methods, such as meta-regression, are used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. However, it may be difficult to apply such a method in complex cases or in the absence of an a priori hypothesis. This paper presents a graphical method to identify trials, groups of trials or groups of patients that are sources of heterogeneity. The contribution of these trials to the overall result can also be evaluated with this method. Each trial is represented by a dot on a 2D graph. The X-axis represents the contribution of the trial to the overall Cochran Q-test for heterogeneity. The Y-axis represents the influence of the trial, defined as the standardized squared difference between the treatment effects estimated with and without the trial. This approach has been applied to data from the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) comprising 10,850 patients in 65 randomized trials. The graphical method allowed us to identify trials that contributed considerably to the overall heterogeneity and had a strong influence on the overall result. It also provided useful information for the interpretation of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. The proposed graphical method identifies trials that account for most of the heterogeneity without having to explore all possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses. This method can also be applied to identify types of patients that explain heterogeneity in the treatment effect.},

@article{Beeckman.2019,
 abstract = {Background: Parental behavior can influence how well adolescents cope with chronic pain. Previous research has largely focused on how parents negatively impact adolescent functioning. Yet more recent work suggests that parents-and particularly parental psychological flexibility-can foster better adolescent pain-related functioning. In this study we examined if parental protective responses and instructions to engage in activities in the presence of pain mediate the impact of parental psychological flexibility and acceptance of adolescent pain on adolescents' daily pain-related behavior. Method: Fifty-six adolescents with chronic pain (Mage = 14.5 years, 86{\%} girls) and one of their parents (93{\%} mothers) were recruited at initial evaluation at two pediatric pain clinics in the US. Parents completed baseline questionnaires assessing psychologically flexible parenting and acceptance of adolescent pain. Next, parents and adolescents completed a 14-day self-report diary assessing adolescent activity-avoidance and activity-engagement in the presence of pain (adolescent report), and parental protective responses and instructions for their adolescent to engage in activities (parent report). Results: Psychologically flexible parenting and acceptance of adolescent pain in parents were indirectly related to lower daily adolescent activity-avoidance, via their negative association with daily parental protective responses. Positive associations also emerged between baseline psychologically flexible parenting and overall levels of adolescent activity-engagement via its negative association with overall levels of parental protectiveness across the 14-day period. Psychologically flexible parenting and parental acceptance of adolescent pain were also indirectly related to daily decreases in adolescent activity-avoidance via their association with daily increases in parental activity-engagement instructions. These baseline parental resilience factors were also positively related to overall levels of parental engagement instructions, a route via which an indirect association with both higher overall activity-engagement as well as higher overall activity-avoidance in the adolescent was observed. Conclusion: Our findings suggest an (indirect) adaptive role of parental psychological flexibility on adolescent daily pain-related behavior via its impact on parental protective behavior. If our findings replicate, they would suggest that these parental behaviors could be targeted in pain treatments that include both adolescents and their parents. Future research could further examine the impact of parental instructions on pain-related behavior in adolescents with chronic pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{BeltranAlacreu.2015,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a multimodal treatment in the short and medium term for disability in nonspecific chronic neck pain.

DESIGN

The design of this study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial carried out in a university research laboratory. Forty-five patients between 18 and 65 yrs with nonspecific chronic neck pain were included in this study. Each patient was treated eight times over a 4-wk period. The sample was divided into three groups: control group, subjected to a protocol of manual therapy; experimental group 1, subjected to a protocol of manual therapy and therapeutic patient education; and experimental group 2, subjected to manual therapy, therapeutic patient education, and a therapeutic exercise protocol. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 4, 8, and 16 wks using the following measurements: the Neck Disability Index, the 11-item Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, the Neck Flexor Muscle Endurance Test, and the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale.

RESULTS

The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test for the Neck Disability Index showed statistically significant differences between baseline outcomes and all follow-up periods (P {\textless} 0.01). In the Kruskal-Wallis test, differences were found for the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale and the Neck Flexor Muscle Endurance Test in the follow-ups at 8 and 16 wks (P {\textless} 0.05). Analysis of variance for group $\times$ time interaction showed statistically significant changes (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, F = 3.613, P = 0.005; Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, F = 2.803, P = 0.022). Minimal detectable changes were obtained in both experimental groups for the 11-item Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia but not in the control group.

CONCLUSION

Differences between experimental groups and the control group were found in the short and medium term. A multimodal treatment is a good method for reducing disability in patients with nonspecific chronic neck pain in the short and medium term.},

@article{Benjamin.2021,
 abstract = {Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is estimated to occur in up to 1{\%} of adolescents, with symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, and pain impacting daily functioning. However, many risk factors and symptoms for POTS overlap with those of youth with disordered eating, and adolescents with POTS may be at increased risk for developing eating disorders. Therefore, the present study sought to better understand this overlap. We hypothesized that patients with POTS would have higher than expected rates of weight change, restrictive eating patterns, and food sensitivities. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 96 adolescents and young adults diagnosed with POTS who were participating in a 3-week intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. We conducted descriptive and correlational statistical analyses on data from self-report measures, biomarkers of nutritional status, and abstracted information about eating and weight concerns from medical notes. Nearly 3 quarters of participants described engaging in restrictive eating, and more than half of them described experiencing weight loss. They also endorsed experiencing food allergies, celiac disease, and eating disorder at higher rates than would be expected in the general population. One-fifth of the sample had experienced invasive interventions to correct for nutritional imbalances, such as having a feeding tube. Weight and eating are clear areas of risk for patients with orthostatic intolerance. It is essential that treatment team members thoroughly screen for eating disturbances and make recommendations that support regular and balanced eating habits.

@article{Benore.2015,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

This study investigates the relationship between anxiety reduction and functional outcomes in children and adolescents receiving intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation services for chronic pain (CP). Specifically, we evaluated whether: (1) anxiety changes over the course of treatment; (2) anxiety covaries with functional outcomes to rehabilitation; and (3) change in anxiety predicts change in functional outcomes from rehabilitation for CP. Using 3 separate measures assessing anxiety-related constructs, we hypothesized that anxiety would be associated with functioning, both before and following intensive rehabilitation for CP. Further, we hypothesized that a decrease in anxiety-related symptoms following rehabilitation would predict a positive change in functional outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our sample consisted of 119 children and adolescents treated for CP in an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program between 2007 and 2012. Children completed 3 measures related to anxiety (general anxiety, pain-specific anxiety, pain catastrophizing) and 2 functional outcome measures (eg, Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire, PedsQL) as part of clinical care.

RESULTS

Measures of anxiety-related constructs were significantly correlated with measures of impairment and functioning, both at admission and at 1-month postdischarge. Regression analyses demonstrated that, after controlling for age, sex, and pain level at admission, a decrease in anxiety significantly predicted between 14{\%} and 40{\%} unique variance in functional outcomes.

DISCUSSION

The findings of this study support existing research on anxiety and CP, specifically the relationship between anxiety and pain-related disability. This study also supports the benefit of intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation for both reducing anxiety and increasing functional outcomes, suggesting a possible link in children's response to intervention. Study limitations and future directions for related research are discussed.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Valid and efficient assessment of patient-reported outcomes remains a priority to guide pain treatment and research. PROMIS pediatric self-report and parent proxy measures offer feasible and rigorous evaluation of functioning in children with chronic conditions, including pain. A key challenge is determining the usefulness of multisource information from children and caregivers for understanding pain and function. Our primary aim examined child-caregiver agreement across child functioning domains. Our secondary aim examined child and caregiver factors associated with the child-caregiver agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 806 children with chronic pain (Mage=14.50 y; 72{\%} female individuals) and a caregiver (Mage=45.82 y; 85{\%} mothers) completed PROMIS pediatric self-report and parent proxy measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and mobility before intake in an interdisciplinary outpatient pediatric chronic pain program. RESULTS: The agreement was poor to good depending on the evaluation method (effect size, intraclass correlation, and clinical significance interpretation). Caregivers generally reported worse child symptoms across domains compared with child self-report. The greatest discrepancy was observed for child anxiety, pain interference, and peer relations, with the greatest agreement for child mobility. The greater caregiver-child discrepancy was found for younger children, girls, with a higher child or caregiver pain catastrophizing, and poorer caregiver physical or mental health. DISCUSSION: Findings are discussed within the interpersonal context of pain and indicate the relevance of both child and caregiver perspectives to personalize chronic pain assessment and treatment. Findings can be used by clinicians and researchers to guide whether and how to integrate multi-informant reports about child chronic pain functioning.},

@article{Boggero.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) programs have been shown to restore function, improve coping, and reduce pain in adolescents with chronic pain. Yet, little is known about patients' sleep during IIPT and whether or not improvements in pain treatment outcomes are associated with changes in sleep pre-to-post IIPT treatment. The objectives of the current study were to describe sleep among adolescents entering IIPT and examine associations between sleep parameters and IIPT treatment effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Self-reported sleep measures and clinical outcomes (eg, functional disability, coping, average pain), were collected from 44 adolescents (mean age=14.57, 68.2{\%} female) at admission and discharge from an inpatient IIPT program. Wrist-worn actigraphy data and sleep diaries from participants' first week and last week in the program were analyzed to characterize sleep parameters.

RESULTS

Participants self-reported poor sleep/wake patterns, high levels of insomnia symptoms, and subclinical problems with daytime sleepiness upon admission into IIPT, although actigraphic indices of sleep from the first week of IIPT admission were only just under clinical guidelines for healthy adolescent sleep. Better self-reported sleep quality assessed via aggregated sleep diaries from the first week was associated with improvement in average pain and disability over the course of the program. Furthermore, improvements in insomnia symptoms and daytime sleepiness throughout the program were positively correlated with concurrent improvements in functional disability and coping.

DISCUSSION

Taken together, results suggest that sleep may be associated with IIPT treatment effects and pave the way for future research to continue examining these relationships.},

@article{Bowden.2011,
 abstract = {Meta-analyses of individual patient data (IPD) provide a strong and authoritative basis for evidence synthesis. IPD are particularly useful when the outcome of interest is the time to an event. Methodological developments now enable the meta-analysis of time-to-event IPD using a single model, allowing treatment effect and across-trial heterogeneity parameters to be estimated simultaneously. This differs from the standard approaches used with aggregate data, and also predominantly with IPD. Facilitated by a simulation study, we investigate what these new 'one-stage' random-effects models offer over standard 'two-stage' approaches. We find that two-stage approaches represent a robust, reliable and easily implementable way to estimate treatment effects and account for heterogeneity. Nevertheless, one-stage models can be used to provide a deeper insight into the data. Software for fitting one-stage Cox models with random effects using Restricted Maximum Likelihood methodology is made available, and its use demonstrated on an IPD meta-analysis assessing post-operative radio therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

@article{Brna.2005,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Headaches affect most children and rank third among illness-related causes of school absenteeism. Although the short-term outcome for most children appears favorable, few studies have reported long-term outcome.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the long-term prognosis of childhood headaches 20 years after initial diagnosis in a cohort of Atlantic Canadian children who had headaches diagnosed in 1983.

METHODS

Ninety-five patients with headaches who consulted 1 of the authors in 1983 were previously studied in 1993. The 77 patients contacted in 1993 were followed up in 2003. A standardized interview protocol was used.

RESULTS

Sixty (78{\%}) of 77 patients responded (60 of the 95 of the original cohort). At 20-year follow-up, 16 (27{\%}) were headache free, 20 (33{\%}) had tension-type headaches, 10 (17{\%}) had migraine, and 14 (23{\%}) had migraine and tension-type headaches. Having more than 1 headache type was more prevalent than at diagnosis or initial follow-up (P{\textless}.001), and headache type varied across time. Of those with headaches at follow-up, 80{\%} (35/44) described their headaches as moderate or severe, although an improvement in headaches was reported by 29 (66{\%}). Tension-type headaches were more likely than migraine to remit (P{\textless}.04). Headache severity at diagnosis was predictive of headache outcome at 20 years. During the month before follow-up, nonprescription medications were used by 31 (70{\%}) of those with ongoing headaches, and prescription medications were used by 6 (14{\%}). However, 20 (45{\%}) believed that nonpharmacological methods were most effective. Medication use increased during the 10 years since last follow-up. No patient used selective serotonin receptor agonists (triptans).

CONCLUSIONS

Twenty years after diagnosis of pediatric headache, most patients continue to have headache, although the headache classification often changes across time. Most patients report moderate or severe headache and increasingly choose to care for their headaches pharmacologically.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

This study examined key functional outcomes following a 3-week interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation program for adolescents with chronic pain. Maintenance of gains was evaluated at 3-month follow-up.

METHODS

Participants included 171 adolescents (12 to 18 y of age) with chronic pain who completed a hospital-based outpatient pediatric pain rehabilitation program. Participants completed measures of functional disability, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, opioid use, school attendance, and pain severity at admission, discharge, and at 3-month follow-up.

RESULTS

Similar to other interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation program outcome studies, significant improvements were observed at the end of the program. These improvements appeared to be maintained or further improved at 3-month follow-up. Nearly 14{\%} of the patients were taking daily opioid medication at admission to the program. All adolescents were completely tapered off of these medications at the end of the 3-week program and remained abstinent at 3-month follow-up.

DISCUSSION

This study adds to the available data supporting interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation as effective in improving functioning and psychological distress even when discontinuing opioids. Implications for future research and limitations of the study are discussed.},

The clinical relevance of marijuana withdrawal has not been established. This study is the first to document the incidence and severity of perceived marijuana withdrawal symptoms in a clinical sample of marijuana-dependent adults.

MEASUREMENTS

Fifty-four people seeking outpatient treatment for marijuana dependence completed a 22-item Marijuana Withdrawal Symptom checklist based on their most recent period of marijuana abstinence.

FINDINGS

The majority (57{\%}) indicated that they had experienced {\textgreater} or = six symptoms of at least moderate severity and 47{\%} experienced {\textgreater} or = four symptoms rated as severe. Withdrawal severity was greater in those with psychiatric symptomatology and more frequent marijuana use.

CONCLUSIONS

This study provides further support for a cluster of withdrawal symptoms experienced following cessation of regular marijuana use. The affective and behavioral symptoms reported were consistent with those observed in previous laboratory and interview studies. Since withdrawal symptoms are frequently a target for clinical intervention with other substances of abuse, this may also be appropriate for marijuana.},

Evaluate psychometric properties of the Pediatric Insomnia Severity Index (PISI), a brief measure of insomnia severity.

Methods

Clinically referred youth ( n = 462; 283 males, 179 females, mean age = 7.28 $\pm$ 2.05 years) and their caregiver(s) completed sleep evaluation including the PISI, Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and sleep disorders inventory for students. Tests of reliability and validity and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to assess PISI psychometric properties. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine insomnia severity by insomnia diagnosis.

Results

Measures of internal consistency for the PISI factor scores varied. CFA indicated that a two-factor model had optimal fit relative to a single-factor solution. Overall, convergent and discriminant validity of PISI factors were supported. Insomnia severity varied by diagnosis.

Conclusions

Findings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the PISI within a large pediatric sample and for its clinical utility as a brief measure of insomnia severity.},

@article{Clementi.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Conceptual links between perfectionism and chronic pain have been proposed yet minimal empirical data exists. Poor sleep is associated with high levels of perfectionism and is common among youth with chronic pain. This study explores associations between perfectionism and sleep quality in adolescents with chronic pain while considering levels of functional disability.

METHODS

Adolescents (ages 12-18) with chronic pain (N = 423) completed baseline measures of self-oriented perfectionism (SOP), socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), sleep quality, and functional disability as part of routine clinical care at an outpatient chronic pain clinic and a pain rehabilitation day treatment program. Multivariate multiple regression assessed associations between perfectionism (SOP and SPP) and sleep (falling asleep/reinitiating sleep, returning to wakefulness, and going to bed). Two moderation models explored how relations between perfectionism (SOP and SPP) and sleep quality (total score) varied depending on level of functional disability. All analyses controlled for clinic setting.

RESULTS

Results indicated SPP was associated with more difficulties across all sleep subdomains in adolescents with chronic pain, while SOP was unrelated to sleep quality. Associations between perfectionism and sleep quality were dependent on functional disability; perfectionism was most strongly associated with worse sleep quality for adolescents with less functional disability.

CONCLUSIONS

This study highlights the relationship between perfectionism and sleep quality in adolescents with chronic pain and suggests that perfectionistic youth with less disability are at the greatest risk for sleep problems. Longitudinal research is needed to understand how perfectionism, sleep, and disability interact over time in youth with chronic pain.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

In children and adolescents we investigated the impact of a 3-week inpatient multimodal pain therapy on subjective burden of life, pain intensity, and number of days off from school 3, 6, or 12 months later.

METHODS

At the beginning of therapy (inpatient setting) and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter (outpatient setting) we collected the respective data using standardized questionnaires. For statistical analysis we used Wilcoxon's signed rank test. A p {\textless}0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

RESULTS

A total of 72 patients aged 7.5-18.2 years suffering daily pain entered the study, most of them being diagnosed with somatoform pain disease. After 3, 6, and 12 months, 65, 27, and 30 patients could be reevaluated. Mean pain intensity of the week before data acquisition was significantly less than at the beginning (2.9, 2.3, and 2.9 vs 6.3) as was the mean number of days off from school due to pain during the 4-week period before each day of data acquisition (1.8, 1.5, and 1.4 vs 9.2). Mean subjective burden of life was significantly less than at the beginning (24.5, 22.0, and 25.8 vs 37.8).

CONCLUSION

Outpatient multimodal pain therapy has a sustained impact on children and adolescents suffering from chronic pain.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

A prospective study controlled for sex and age was conducted evaluating the success of a 3-week inpatient pain therapy after 3, 6 and 12 months for 200 children and adolescents severely disabled due to chronic pain.

METHODS

The following validated German questionnaires were used: pain questionnaire (DSF-K/J/E), pain coping inventory (PPCI-R), anxiety questionnaire (AFS) and depression questionnaire (DIKJ). After an intention-to-treat analysis unifactorial und multifactorial variance analyses were conducted. A significance level of p{\textless}0.01 was used.

RESULTS

Durable improvements were observed for average pain intensity, pain disability, days absent from school, depression and for passive and interaction-based pain coping strategies 3 months after finishing inpatient pain therapy. On the other hand general anxiety and school aversion were only reduced at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Girls reported more pain in general and during follow-up. Younger children relied in general more on others when dealing with their pain.

CONCLUSION

An inpatient pain therapy can help children and adolescents severely disabled due to chronic pain not only in the short term but also in the long term.},

Intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) was found to positively affect pain-related and emotional outcomes in pediatric patients with chronic pain up to 4 years after treatment. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of IIPT on solely pediatric chronic headache patients. As part of a longitudinal observation study, n = 70 children and adolescents with chronic headache receiving IIPT were included, of which n = 47 completed the assessment at four assessment time points: before treatment (PRE) and at three follow-ups (6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, and 4-YEAR FOLLOW-UP). Pain-related (pain intensity, pain-related disability, school absence), as well as psychological outcome domains (anxiety, depression), were investigated. The results support the short-term and long-term efficacy of IIPT for pediatric chronic headache patients regarding the pain-related outcome measures by significant reductions from PRE to all follow-up measure points. For anxiety and depression, only short-term improvements were found. Future studies should specifically focus on the identification of methods to consolidate the beneficial short-term effects of IIPT on psychological outcome domains in the long term.},

@article{Dougherty.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Children with amplified musculoskeletal pain (AMPS) experience significant functional disability, with impairment in their ability to participate in age-appropriate activities of daily living. Parental factors play an important role in a child's pain symptoms and treatment outcomes, with parental pain catastrophizing and protective behaviors linked to several maladaptive outcomes for children. Aims of the current study were to examine how parental pain catastrophizing, child pain catastrophizing, and parental protective behaviors longitudinally impacted functional disability for children with AMPS. METHODS: Archival data were examined from parent-child dyads presenting to a tertiary pain clinic for treatment of AMPS. Over 1 year, parents completed measures assessing the level of pain catastrophizing, common behavioral responses to child pain, and child functional disability. Children completed measures of pain catastrophizing and functional disability. Measures were collected at initial evaluation, 6-months, and 12-months. Latent growth models (LGM) were conducted to examine how to study variables longitudinally impacted the rate of change in child functional disability. RESULTS: Examining a comprehensive LGM of study variables, parental catastrophizing emerged as the sole contributing factor to slower improvement in functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: The strong influence of parental pain catastrophizing on functional disability may relate to parents limiting behaviors that promote adaptive coping in children with pain. As such, parents who catastrophize may benefit from specific interventions to increase their use of adaptive behavioral responses, such as redirecting children to complete functional activities and encouraging the use of positive coping skills for pain-related distress.},

@article{Du.2011,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Pain among children is common, yet far less studied compared to that among adults. Little has been reported regarding various types of pain in a national community sample of German children.

METHODS

We examined pain experienced within a 3 month timeframe among 14,836 children and adolescents aged 3-17 years old, who participated in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) 2003-2006.

RESULTS

The 3-month prevalence rate was 71{\%} for any pain, 47{\%} for recurrent pain, 55{\%} for pain at multiple ($\geq$2) locations and 27{\%} for recurrent pain at multiple locations. Headache and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported (44.2{\%}, 40.8{\%}) either as recurrent (22.8{\%}, 20.3{\%}) or as the most bothersome pain (MBP) (19.6{\%}, 14.7{\%}). Children from immigrant vs. non-immigrant families and children from lower vs. upper social-class families showed significantly higher prevalence rates for tooth (14{\%} vs. 10{\%}), lower abdomen (10{\%} vs. 7{\%}), chest (9{\%} vs. 7{\%}), arm (9{\%} vs. 6{\%}) and eye pain (9{\%} vs. 5{\%}). Of children with repeated MBP, only 10{\%} of them used medications or consulted a doctor about the pain 'often/always,' while the majority of them did not act at all. In general, older age groups, females, poor health status and urban residence were associated with pain in children.

CONCLUSIONS

The rather high pain prevalence suggests pain among children may be a potential public health issue. Further studies are required to investigate the characteristics and correlational attributes of children suffering most frequently from pain and children from families with low socioeconomic status.},

To determine the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary cognitive behavioural treatment for adolescents with chronic pain.

METHODS

Fifty seven adolescents (mean age 14.28 years) with chronic pain and 57 accompanying adults underwent an interdisciplinary three week residential programme of group cognitive behavioural therapy. Mean chronicity of pain was 4.02 years; 75{\%} were absent from full time education (mean absence 17 months).

RESULTS

Post-treatment adolescents reported significant improvements for self report of disability (mean difference 3.37 (95{\%} CI 0.65 to 6.09)), physical function (mean difference timed walk of 2.61 seconds (1.02 to 4.2) and sit to stand of 3.22 per minute (0.79 to 5.65)). At three months post-treatment adolescents maintained physical improvements and reduced anxiety (mean difference 1.7 (0.72 to 2.67)), disability (mean difference 4.3 (1.44 to 7.17)), and somatic awareness (mean difference 4.43 (1.53 to 7.33)). Following treatment adults reported significant improvement in their report of adolescent disability (mean difference 4.43 (2.17 to 6.7)), adult anxiety (mean difference 1.73 (0.54 to 2.92)), depression (mean difference 1.16 (0.34 to 1.98)), and parental stress (mean difference 10.81 (2.91 to 18.78)). At three months significant improvements were maintained. At three months 64{\%} improved school attendance; 40{\%} had returned to full time education.

CONCLUSIONS

Interdisciplinary cognitive behavioural pain management (with family involvement) is a promising approach to the management of pain, pain related distress, and disability.},

Here, we investigated (a) gray matter (GM) differences between patients with CRPS and healthy controls and (b) GM and functional connectivity (FC) changes in patients following intensive interdisciplinary psychophysical pain treatment. Twenty-three patients (13 females, 9 males; average age~$\pm$~SD~=~13.3~$\pm$~2.5~years) and 21 healthy sex- and age-matched controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to controls, patients had reduced GM in the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, midcingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hippocampus. Following treatment, patients had increased GM in the dlPFC, thalamus, basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and enhanced FC between the dlPFC and the periaqueductal gray, two regions involved in descending pain modulation. Accordingly, our results provide novel evidence for GM abnormalities in sensory, motor, emotional, cognitive, and pain modulatory regions in children with CRPS. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate rapid treatment-induced GM and FC changes in areas implicated in sensation, emotion, cognition, and pain modulation.},

Examine the cost-effectiveness of a 3-week interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain rehabilitation program.

METHODS

Self-reported health care utilization and parent missed work of youth with chronic pain (n = 127) at admission and 1-year follow-up were compared. Financials were calculated from program revenue and established national costs for health care and wages.

RESULTS

Data indicate significant reductions in days hospitalized, physician office visits, physical/occupational therapy services, psychotherapy visits, and parental missed work. Estimated health care expenses were {\$}61,988 in the year before admission and {\$}14,189 in the year after admission (-{\$}58,839). Estimated cost of missed work was {\$}12,229 in the year prior and {\$}1,189 in the year after (-{\$}11,039).

The current study aimed to examine the effects of a biofeedback intervention involving individual and group sessions to facilitate increased self-regulatory skills for chronic pain management and to translate these skills to meaningful activities promoting functional restoration. Methods: Participants included 104 adolescents (ages 12-18) attending an intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program for chronic pain/symptoms and completed biofeedback training as part of the program. The biofeedback protocol consisted of six sessions, including an assessment of baseline physiologic states, diaphragmatic breath training, and various biofeedback screens to reinforce self-regulatory skills within individual- and group-based formats. Results: As expected, patients showed significant reductions in respiration rates and muscle tension from admission to discharge. Ratings of perceived confidence also increased from admission to post-treatment, suggesting greater self-efficacy in patients using self-regulatory skills during their daily functional activities. Conclusions: An individual- and group-based biofeedback protocol with a focus on training skills in activities relevant to adolescents' lives has the potential to improve self-regulation skills and generalize these skills to real-world settings. Future randomized controlled trials are necessary to examine the efficacy of biofeedback interventions to improve physiologic regulation and enhance treatment outcomes for pediatric chronic pain.},

@article{Felt.2017,
 abstract = {Objective: The stress response is a dynamic process that can be characterized by predictable biochemical and psychological changes. Biomarkers of the stress response are typically measured over time and require statistical methods that can model change over time. One flexible method of evaluating change over time is the latent growth curve model (LGCM). However, stress researchers seldom use the LGCM when studying biomarkers, despite their benefits. Stress researchers may be unaware of how these methods can be useful. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of LGCMs in the context of stress research. We specifically highlight the unique benefits of using these approaches. Methods: Hypothetical examples are used to describe four forms of the LGCM. Results: The following four specifications of the LGCM are described: basic LGCM, latent growth mixture model, piecewise LGCM, and LGCM for two parallel processes. The specifications of the LGCM are discussed in the context of the Trier Social Stress Test. Beyond the discussion of the four models, we present issues of modeling nonlinear patterns of change, assessing model fit, and linking specific research questions regarding biomarker research using different statistical models. Conclusions: The final sections of the paper discuss statistical software packages and more advanced modeling capabilities of LGCMs. The online Appendix contains example code with annotation from two statistical programs for the LCGM.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

To date, no German instrument exists to measure pain-related fear in paediatric pain populations. The objective of the current study was to determine the construct validity of the translated German fear of pain questionnaire for children (GFOPQ-C) in a sample of children with mixed chronic pain disorders by testing the underlying factor structure, and its psychometric properties.

METHOD

N~=~241 children with mixed chronic pain disorders (aged 8-19~years) presenting to a specialized pain clinic completed the GFOPQ-C and several other pain, fear and disability measures.

RESULTS

The two-factor structure of the FOPQ-C (fear, avoidance) was replicated. Internal consistency for the shortened German version was good for both subscales (Fear subscale: \textgreek{a}~=~0.89; avoidance subscale: \textgreek{a}~=~0.76). As expected, the fear subscale correlated highly with anxiety sensitivity (r~=~0.63), pain catastrophizing (r~=~0.62) and general anxiety (r~=~0.54), while the avoidance subscale was more closely related to disability (r~=~0.24) and school functioning (r~=~0.28). Pain-related fear differed in children with chronic pain depending on their pain location with higher fear ratings in children with abdominal pain and musculoskeletal pain.

CONCLUSION

The GFOPQ-C is a valid instrument that assesses two distinct dimensions of pain-related fear in children: fear and avoidance. Future research is needed to evaluate the impact of increased pain-related fear on outcomes over time as well as to examine pain-related fear among healthy children. This will enhance our knowledge of who might be particularly vulnerable to potentially dysfunctional trajectories, such as ongoing pain or anxiety symptoms.

SIGNIFICANCE

The current study validates the first tool to assess pain-related fear in German-speaking children with chronic pain. Findings support two distinct domains: fear and activity avoidance.},

@article{Flack.2018,
 abstract = {Fear of pain plays an important role in the maintenance of chronic pain. It may be reduced through exposure therapy. This 2-arm parallel samples randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate whether interoceptive exposure (IE) therapy enhances reductions in fear of pain (primary outcome), pain (pain intensity, pain-related disability, and school absence), and emotional characteristics (anxiety and catastrophizing) when implemented as an adjunctive treatment in the context of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment for pediatric chronic pain patients. N = 126 adolescents, aged 11 to 17 years, who were receiving standard intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment were randomly assigned to either receive additional IE (n = 64) or additional relaxation therapy (RT) (n = 62). All patients were assessed at admission, discharge, and 3 months after discharge. The data of N = 104 patients were analyzed. Significant large reductions were found in the total score and subscale scores of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire for Children in both study groups (eg, total score [range 0-60; IE/RT]: admission M = 23.5/24.9; discharge M = 16.0/19.7; P {\textless} 0.001, (Equation is included in full-text article.)= 0.27) and mainly large reductions in pain characteristics. There were no greater decreases in the IE group (P {\textgreater} 0.1). The exploratory analyses revealed that the patients with high fear of pain before treatment (P {\textless} 0.05, (Equation is included in full-text article.){\textgreater} 0.03) and the patients with abdominal pain (P {\textless} 0.04, (Equation is included in full-text article.){\textgreater} 0.25) showed greater decreases in their fear of pain (total and subscale score) in the IE group than in the RT group. In conclusion, the results suggest that IE is not particularly effective for all the pediatric chronic pain patients, but the patients with high fear of pain before treatment and with abdominal pain strongly benefit from this intervention.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Psychological treatments for pediatric chronic pain are moderately effective. However, there have been few studies of the psychological processes associated with treatment response. This study examines the effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) treatment on a severely disabled group of adolescents with chronic pain, examining relationships between outcome and acceptance.

METHODS

98 adolescents with pain, mean age 15.6 years, underwent an uncontrolled trial of 3-week residential ACT treatment.

RESULTS

Adolescents improved in self-reported functioning and objective physical performance at 3-month follow-up. They were less anxious and catastrophic, attended school more regularly, and used health care facilities less often. Most positive treatment outcomes were associated with improvements in acceptance.

CONCLUSIONS

An intensive ACT-based pain rehabilitation course was an effective treatment for disabled adolescents with chronic pain. Its results were theoretically consistent--improvements were associated with changes in acceptance and were achieved without pain control or cognitive restructuring techniques.},

It provides several different techniques for dealing with missing values in trajectories (classical ones like linear interpolation or LOCF but also new ones like copyMean). It can run k-means with distances specifically designed for longitudinal data (like Frechet distance or any user-defined distance). Its graphical interface helps the user to choose the appropriate number of clusters when classic criteria are not efficient. It also provides an easy way to export graphical representations of the mean trajectories resulting from the clustering. Finally, it runs the algorithm several times, using various kinds of starting conditions and/or numbers of clusters to be sought, thus sparing the user a lot of manual re-sampling.},

@article{Genolini.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Longitudinal data are data in which each variable is measured repeatedly over time. One possibility for the analysis of such data is to cluster them. The majority of clustering methods group together individual that have close trajectories at given time points. These methods group trajectories that are locally close but not necessarily those that have similar shapes. However, in several circumstances, the progress of a phenomenon may be more important than the moment at which it occurs. One would thus like to achieve a partitioning where each group gathers individuals whose trajectories have similar shapes whatever the time lag between them.

METHOD

In this article, we present a longitudinal data partitioning algorithm based on the shapes of the trajectories rather than on classical distances. Because this algorithm is time consuming, we propose as well two data simplification procedures that make it applicable to high dimensional datasets.

RESULTS

In an application to Alzheimer disease, this algorithm revealed a {\textquotedbl}rapid decline{\textquotedbl} patient group that was not found by the classical methods. In another application to the feminine menstrual cycle, the algorithm showed, contrarily to the current literature, that the luteinizing hormone presents two peaks in an important proportion of women (22{\%}).},

To assess the level of resilience among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and their parents and to determine factors associated with patient and parental resilience.

STUDY DESIGN

Cross-sectional cohort study of children aged 13-17~years diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain and their parents. Patient-parent pairs were seen for initial consultation in the pediatric rheumatology pain clinic at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between March and May 2018 and were administered a series of questionnaires including measures of resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 item, The 14-item Resilience Scale, and the 7Cs of Resilience Tool). We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to examine the relationship between the variables of interest and resilience.

RESULTS

According to all resilience measures, patients and parents had low to moderate levels of resilience. These levels were lower than those previously reported among healthy populations, as well as those with chronic medical conditions. According to the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 item, patient-level resilience was negatively correlated with pain level (r~=~-0.48), physical disability (r~=~-0.54), and symptom severity (r~=~-0.53). The level of resilience among patients was positively correlated with energy level (r~=~0.57) and health-related quality of life (r~=~0.64). Parental resilience was positively correlated with parental mental health (r~=~0.61).

CONCLUSIONS

Higher patient resilience was correlated with reduced disease severity among adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Future research should explore whether fostering resilience in adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain via the application of resilience-training interventions mitigates disease burden in this vulnerable patient population.},

@article{Gobina.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Reports of the overall chronic pain prevalence and its associated demographic characteristics among adolescents vary greatly across existing studies. Using internationally comparable data, this study investigates age, sex and country-level effects in the prevalence of chronic single-site and multi-site pain among adolescents during the last six months preceding the survey.

METHODS

Data (n~=~214,283) from the 2013/2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study were used including nationally representative samples of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds from general schools in 42 participating countries. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used.

RESULTS

The overall proportion of adolescents reporting chronic weekly pain during the last six months was high (44.2{\%}). On average, in comparison with different specific localized types of single-site pain, the prevalence of multi-site pain was more common varying from 13.2{\%} in Armenia to 33.8{\%} in Israel. Adolescent age and sex were strong predictors for reporting pain, but significantly different demographic patterns were found in the cross-country analyses. The most consistent findings indicate that multi-site pain was more prevalent among girls across all countries and that the prevalence increased with age.

CONCLUSIONS

Internationally comparable data suggest that self-reported chronic pain among adolescents is highly prevalent, but different age and sex patterns across countries exist. Adolescents with chronic pain are not a homogenous group. Chronic pain co-occurrence and differences in chronic pain characteristics should be addressed in both clinical and public health practice for effective adolescent chronic pain management and prevention.

SIGNIFICANCE

Chronic pain co-occurrence is common during adolescence across countries, the prevalence being among girls and in older age groups. Significant cross-country variations in the chronic pain prevalence and chronic pain patterns among adolescents exist. Significant country differences emerge for specific chronic pain patterns in association with adolescent demographics.},

@article{Goddard.2021,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Assessment of outcomes from health interventions are of increasing importance, primarily to identify effective and safe treatment, but also to justify funding decisions. The Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire (BAPQ) is a self-report questionnaire, validated in 11-18 year olds, assessing the impact of pain in multiple domains of adolescent life. The similarly validated Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire for Parents (BAPQ-P) uses the same domains as the BAPQ, assessing the functioning and development of the adolescent from the parents' perspective. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study, planning to routinely collect BAPQ/BAPQ-P data at initial assessment and 6 months later. All patients aged between 5 and 19 attending our chronic pain clinic for the first time between December 2009 and December 2014 were mailed BAPQ and BAPQ-P questionnaires before the first appointment and 6 months after the first appointment. RESULTS: In total, 376 of 386 families returned questionnaires at time 0 and 96 after 6 months, 26{\%} of those responded at time 0. We found statistically significant differences on patients' BAPQ questionnaires from 0 to 6 months showing improvement in all domains. A different result was found on parents' questionnaires where we only found a statistically significant difference on daily and emotional functioning. When comparing patient and parent questionnaires at 0 and 6 months, we found statistically significant differences between patients' and parents' questionnaires in the daily functioning and development domains. CONCLUSION: We believe BAPQ and BAPQ-P measurement proved useful tools to assess response to pain management input in adolescents over a 6-month period. Our experience and results suggest that these tools can, with appropriate administrative support, be used in routine clinical practice to assess patient outcomes. We also believe that BAPQ and BAPQ-P measurements have a utility to audit pain clinic activity and potentially a use in demonstrating beneficial outcomes to commissioners.},

@article{Goodman.2008,
 abstract = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the field of pain, virtual reality (VR) technology has been increasingly common in the context of procedural pain management. As an interactive technology tool, VR has the potential to be extended beyond acute pain management to chronic pain rehabilitation with a focus on increasing engagement with painful or avoided movements. OBJECTIVE: We outline the development and initial implementation of a VR program in pain rehabilitation intervention to enhance function in youth with chronic pain. METHODS: We present the development, acceptability, feasibility, and utility of an innovative VR program (Fruity Feet) for pediatric pain rehabilitation to facilitate increased upper and lower extremity engagement. The development team was an interdisciplinary group of pediatric experts, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, pain psychologists, anesthesiologists, pain researchers, and a VR software developer. We used a 4-phase iterative development process that engaged clinicians, parents, and patients via interviews and standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: This study included 17 pediatric patients (13 female, 4 male) enrolled in an intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program, with mean age of 13.24 (range 7-17) years, completing a total of 63 VR sessions. Overall reports of presence were high (mean 28.98; max 40; SD 4.02), suggestive of a high level of immersion. Among those with multisession data (n=8), reports of pain (P{\textless}.001), fear (P=.003), avoidance (P=.004), and functional limitations (P=.01) significantly decreased. Qualitative analysis revealed (1) a positive experience with VR (eg, enjoyed VR, would like to utilize the VR program again, felt VR was a helpful tool); (2) feeling distracted from pain while engaged in VR; (3) greater perceived mobility; and (4) fewer clinician-observed pain behaviors during VR. Movement data support the targeted impact of the Fruity Feet compared to other available VR programs. CONCLUSIONS: The iterative development process yielded a highly engaging and feasible VR program based on qualitative feedback, questionnaires, and movement data. We discuss next steps for the refinement, implementation, and assessment of impact of VR on chronic pain rehabilitation. VR holds great promise as a tool to facilitate therapeutic gains in chronic pain rehabilitation in a manner that is highly reinforcing and fun.},

@article{Groenewald.2014,
 abstract = {UNLABELLED

The aim of this study was to assess the economic cost of chronic pain among adolescents receiving interdisciplinary pain treatment. Information was gathered from 149 adolescents (ages 10-17) presenting for evaluation and treatment at interdisciplinary pain clinics in the United States. Parents completed a validated measure of family economic attributes, the Client Service Receipt Inventory, to report on health service use and productivity losses due to their child's chronic pain retrospectively over 12 months. Health care costs were calculated by multiplying reported utilization estimates by unit visit costs from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The estimated mean and median costs per participant were {\$}11,787 and {\$}6,770, respectively. Costs were concentrated in a small group of participants; the top 5{\%} of those patients incurring the highest costs accounted for 30{\%} of total costs, whereas the lower 75{\%} of participants accounted for only 34{\%} of costs. Total costs to society for adolescents with moderate to severe chronic pain were extrapolated to {\$}19.5 billion annually in the United States. The cost of adolescent chronic pain presents a substantial economic burden to families and society. Future research should focus on predictors of increased health services use and costs in adolescents with chronic pain.

PERSPECTIVE

This cost of illness study comprehensively estimates the economic costs of chronic pain in a cohort of treatment-seeking adolescents. The primary driver of costs was direct medical costs followed by productivity losses. Because of its economic impact, policy makers should invest resources in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic pediatric pain.},

@article{Hechler.2009,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 3-week multimodal inpatient pain program for children and adolescents with chronic pain.

METHODS

Effectiveness was investigated for pain-related variables (pain intensity, pain-related disability) and emotional distress in 3 ways: (1) in terms of statistically significant changes; (2) in terms of the clinical significance of these changes by creating post-hoc outcome groups for pain-related variables and emotional distress; and (3) in terms of the clinically significant overall amelioration generalizing the outcome over 3 variables (ie, pain intensity, pain-related disability, and school absence). One hundred sixty-seven adolescents (aged between 11 and 18 y) with various pain disorders (50{\%} with headache) who met inpatient criteria were evaluated at baseline and 3 months posttreatment.

RESULTS

Patients demonstrated statistically significant changes in all variables with large to medium effect sizes. Seventy-two percent and 45{\%} of the patients demonstrated clinically significant changes in pain intensity and pain-related disability, respectively. The percentages of patients demonstrating clinically significant change in emotional distress ranged from 13{\%} to 26{\%}. Seventy-seven adolescents demonstrated overall amelioration.

DISCUSSION

Results of the study are promising in at least 2 ways: (1) a multimodal inpatient program might stop the negative effects of chronic pain, disability, and emotional distress in children and adolescents, and (2) the exploration of clinical significance testing has demonstrated utility and can be applied to future effectiveness studies in pediatric pain.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To evaluate short and long-term treatment outcome of children (7-10 years) in comparison to adolescents (11-18 years) with disabling chronic pain following multimodal inpatient pain treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Thirty-three children and 167 adolescents underwent multimodal inpatient pain treatment. Standardized assessment of pain-related variables, disability, coping, and use of analgesics was performed at admission, 3- and 12-month follow-up.

RESULTS

Children and adolescents displayed similar pain-characteristics at admission. Adolescents demonstrated significantly higher disability and passive pain coping. Children relied more on others when in pain. All core variables (i.e., pain intensity, pain-related disability, school absence and pain-related coping) decreased significantly in both children and adolescents after 3 months. Both groups maintained this decline 12 months later. More than half of the children and adolescents demonstrated a 50{\%}-reduction in pain intensity after 3 months, and almost 60{\%} after 12 months. Use of analgesics was significantly reduced at 3-month follow-up with no additional changes after 12 months. While age did not exert any impact on results, there were significant gender differences in pain intensity and school absence. Girls demonstrated higher pain intensity and higher school absence 1 year following treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

Children display similar pain-characteristics to adolescents when entering inpatient treatment. A multimodal inpatient program appears to stop the the long-term vicious cycle of disability and pain for both children and adolescents. The demonstrated gender differences raise issues for further research and the possibility of additional pain management strategies for girls.},

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the {\textquotedbl}pain provocation technique{\textquotedbl} (PPT)--a focused treatment strategy incorporating interoceptive exposure (i.e., imagining increases in pain intensity), bilateral stimulation (tactile stimulation), and implementation of pain-related coping to decrease pain intensity--for adolescents suffering from chronic pain.

DESIGN

Prospective observational comparative study.

METHODS

Adolescents utilizing PPT (19 boys and 21 girls) within multimodal inpatient treatment were compared with adolescents in standard multimodal inpatient treatment matched for age, gender, and diagnosis. Core outcome variables (pain intensity, disability, emotional distress) were assessed at admission and 3 months posttreatment.

RESULTS

Adolescents in the PPT group demonstrated a sharper decrease in pain intensity and school aversion. Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in disability and emotional distress.

CONCLUSIONS

Results are discussed in terms of the importance of focused treatment strategies such as interoceptive exposure for adolescents suffering from disabling chronic pain. Future studies are warranted to carefully investigate the effectiveness and possible process of change during the PPT such as sensory, cognitive, emotional, and memory aspects.},

Intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) might be an effective treatment, given the advantage of consulting with multiple professionals on a daily basis. Evidence for the effectiveness of IIPT is scarce. We investigated the efficacy of an IIPT within a randomized controlled trial by comparing an intervention group (IG) (n=52) to a waiting-list control group (WCG) (n=52). We made assessments before treatment (PRE), immediately after treatment (POST), as well as at short-term (POST6MONTHS) and long-term (POST12MONTHS) follow-up. We determined a combined endpoint, improvement (pain intensity, disability, school absence), and investigated 3 additional outcome domains (anxiety, depression, catastrophizing). We also investigated changes in economic parameters (health care use, parental work absenteeism, subjective financial burden) and their relationship to the child's improvement. Results at POST showed that significantly more children in the IG than in the WCG were assigned to improvement (55{\%} compared to 14{\%}; Fisher P{\textless}.001; 95{\%} confidence interval for incidence difference: 0.21{\%} to 0.60{\%}). Although immediate effects were achieved for disability, school absence, depression, and catastrophizing, pain intensity and anxiety did not change until short-term follow-up. More than 60{\%} of the children in both groups were improved long-term. The parents reported significant reductions in all economic parameters. The results from the present study support the efficacy of the IIPT. Future research is warranted to investigate differences in treatment response and to understand the changes in economic parameters in nonimproved children.},

@article{Hechler.2014b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

In children with chronic pain, interdisciplinary outpatient and intensive inpatient treatment has been shown to improve pain intensity and disability. However, there are few systematic comparisons of outcomes of the two treatments. The present naturalistic study aimed to compare the clinical presentation and achieved changes at return in three outcome domains (pain intensity, disability, school absence) between a) outpatients vs. inpatients and b) patients who declined intensive inpatient treatment and completed outpatient treatment instead (decliners) vs. those who completed inpatient treatment (completers).

METHODS

The study compared treatment outcomes between n = 992 outpatients vs. n = 320 inpatients (Analysis A) who were treated at a tertiary treatment centre and returned for a return visit within a one-year interval. In Analysis B, treatment outcomes were compared between n = 67 decliners vs. n = 309 completers of inpatient treatment. The three outcome domains were compared by calculating standardized change scores and clinically significant changes.

RESULTS

In analysis A, outpatients and inpatients reported comparably low levels of pain intensity (NRS 0-10; mean = 4, SD = 2.7) and disability (Paediatric Pain Disability Index (PPDI: 12-60; mean = 24; SD = 10) at the return visit. Compared to outpatients, more inpatients achieved clinically significant changes in pain intensity (52{\%} vs. 45{\%}) and disability (46{\%} vs. 31{\%}). There were also significantly greater changes in disability in the inpatient group (change score outpatients = 1.0; change score inpatients = 1.4; F(1,1138) = 12.6, p = .011). School absence was substantially reduced, with approximately 80{\%} in each group attending school regularly. Analysis B showed that even though inpatient decliners achieved improvements in the outcome domains, they reported greater disability at the return visit (PPDI mean decliners = 27, SD = 9.9; PPDI mean completers = 24, SD = 10) because they had achieved fewer changes in disability (change score decliners = 0.9; change score completers = 1.4; F(1.334) = 5.7, p = .017). In addition, less decliners than completers achieved clinically significant changes in disability (25{\%} vs. 47{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS

Inpatient and outpatient treatments are able to elicit substantial changes in pain intensity, disability and school absence. The results highlight the necessity of intensive inpatient pain treatment for highly affected children, as children who declined inpatient treatment and were treated as outpatients did less well.},

Pediatric debilitating chronic pain is a severe health problem, often requiring complex interventions such as intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT). Research is lacking regarding the effectiveness of IIPT for children. The objective was to systematically review studies evaluating the effects of IIPT.

METHODS

Cochrane, Medline/Ovid, PsycInfo/OVID, PubMed, PubPsych, and Web of Science were searched. Studies were included if (1) treatment was coordinated by $\geq$3 health professionals, (2) treatment occurred within an inpatient/day hospital setting, (3) patients were {\textless}22 years, (4) patients experienced debilitating chronic pain, (5) the study was published in English, and (6) the study had $\geq$10 participants at posttreatment. The child's pain condition, characteristics of the IIPT, and 5 outcome domains (pain intensity, disability, school functioning, anxiety, depressive symptoms) were extracted at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up.

RESULTS

One randomized controlled trial and 9 nonrandomized treatment studies were identified and a meta-analysis was conducted separately on pain intensity, disability, and depressive symptoms revealing positive treatment effects. At posttreatment, there were large improvements for disability, and small to moderate improvements for pain intensity and depressive symptoms. The positive effects were maintained at short-term follow-up. Findings demonstrated extreme heterogeneity.

CONCLUSIONS

Effects in nonrandomized treatment studies cannot be attributed to IIPT alone. Because of substantial heterogeneity in measures for school functioning and anxiety, meta-analyses could not be computed. There is preliminary evidence for positive treatment effects of IIPT, but the small number of studies and their methodological weaknesses suggest a need for more research on IIPTs for children.

This naturalistic study assesses the effectiveness of inpatient multidisciplinary treatment of children and adolescents with somatic symptom disorders (SSD) and investigates the role of pain coping strategies and psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression).

Methods

Sixty children and adolescents (mean age 14.4~years) with SSD who underwent inpatient multidisciplinary treatment were assessed regarding their school attendance, levels of discomfort, coping strategies and psychiatric comorbidity (depression, anxiety) at pretreatment, discharge and 6~months following treatment.

Results

At discharge, the children and adolescents reported improvements in their level of discomfort, psychiatric comorbidities (anxiety, depression) and pain coping strategies, with medium to large effect sizes. Six months following treatment, the improvements remained stable, including significantly higher school attendance rates (d = 1.6; p {\textless} 0.01). Improvement in pain coping was associated with increased school attendance.

Conclusion

Inpatient multidisciplinary treatment is effective in reducing levels of discomfort, psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression), and school absence and in improving coping strategies.},

 abstract = {UNLABELLED

Pain coping and pain-related cognitions are considered important for the understanding of chronic pain in children. Based on a systematic literature search, 4 instruments were identified that assess a range of pain coping strategies and one questionnaire focusing on pain-related cognitions. Three of these tools have good psychometric quality. Yet, only the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ) has been widely used across different pain conditions and by several international research groups. We designed the Pain-Related Cognitions Questionnaire for Children (PRCQ-C) as an abbreviated German version of the PCQ. Factorial, construct, and external validity were tested in a sample of 401 children and adolescents (7-18 years) comprising 253 school children and 148 children having recurrent pain. The proposed 3 subscales, {\textquotedbl}catastrophizing,{\textquotedbl} {\textquotedbl}problem-solving,{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}positive self-statements,{\textquotedbl} were confirmed, all having good internal consistency and retest reliability. No age and only marginal gender differences were observed. Catastrophizing was associated with dysphoric mood, trait anxiety, and current pain activity. Subgroups of pain patients differed with regard to catastrophizing and positive self-statements.

PERSPECTIVE

The PRCQ-C is a brief instrument for the assessment of pain-related cognitions in children and adolescents. It supports the validity of the PCQ, demonstrates its use in an abbreviated version and extends its international availability.},

 abstract = {Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of 'set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

@article{Hilyard.2020,
 abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic pain is common in adolescents. Evidence-based guidelines recommend interdisciplinary treatment, but access is limited by geography. The development of hybrid programs utilizing both face-to-face and videoconference treatment may help overcome this. We developed a 7-week hybrid pediatric interdisciplinary pain program (Hybrid-PIPP) and wished to compare it to individual face-to-face sessions (Standard Care). Our objective was to test the feasibility of a protocol that used a matched pair un-blinded randomized controlled design to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Hybrid-PIPP compared to Standard Care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited from tertiary pediatric clinics and matched by disability before randomization to minimize allocation bias. The adolescents (aged 11-17) had experienced primary pain for {\textgreater}3 months. Hybrid-PIPP involved 11 hrs of group therapy and 4 individual videoconference sessions. Standard care was provided by the same clinical team, using the same treatment model and similar intensity as the Hybrid-PIPP. The intention was to recruit participants for 3 Hybrid-PIPP groups with a comparison stream. Recruitment was ceased after 2 groups due to the high participant disability requiring more intensive intervention. RESULTS: Eighteen dyads were screened and 13 randomized (7 Hybrid-PIPP, 6 Standard Care, 2 unsuitable, 3 unallocated when the study was stopped). The study met a priori feasibility criteria for staff availability; recruitment rate; treatment completion; and data collection. Global satisfaction ratings were similar in both streams (SC median 7, range 5-9 and Hybrid-PIPP median 8.5, range 5-10). Challenges were identified in both streams. A future modified Hybrid-PIPP was considered acceptable if the intensity is increased to manage the high level of disability. Standard care was considered inefficient. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The study determined that the protocol met a priori feasibility criteria, but to be practicable in a real world, health environment requires significant modifications.

@article{Hippel.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Estimated effects vary across studies, partly because of random sampling error and partly because of heterogeneity. In meta-analysis, the fraction of variance that is due to heterogeneity is estimated by the statistic I(2). We calculate the bias of I(2), focusing on the situation where the number of studies in the meta-analysis is small. Small meta-analyses are common; in the Cochrane Library, the median number of studies per meta-analysis is 7 or fewer.

METHODS

We use Mathematica software to calculate the expectation and bias of I(2).

RESULTS

I(2) has a substantial bias when the number of studies is small. The bias is positive when the true fraction of heterogeneity is small, but the bias is typically negative when the true fraction of heterogeneity is large. For example, with 7 studies and no true heterogeneity, I(2) will overestimate heterogeneity by an average of 12 percentage points, but with 7 studies and 80 percent true heterogeneity, I(2) can underestimate heterogeneity by an average of 28 percentage points. Biases of 12-28 percentage points are not trivial when one considers that, in the Cochrane Library, the median I(2) estimate is 21 percent.

CONCLUSIONS

The point estimate I(2) should be interpreted cautiously when a meta-analysis has few studies. In small meta-analyses, confidence intervals should supplement or replace the biased point estimate I(2).},

@article{Hirschfeld.2013,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To investigate the long-term effectiveness of a 3-week multimodal inpatient program for children and adolescents with chronic pain.

METHODS

167 adolescents were evaluated at pretreatment baseline, 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Long-term effectiveness was investigated for pain-related variables (pain-related disability, school absence, pain intensity) and emotional distress.

RESULTS

We found statistically and clinically significant changes in all variables. After 1 year, the majority (56{\%}) showed overall improvement as indexed by decreased pain-related disability or school absence. 22{\%} had an unsuccessful treatment outcome. Those showing only short-term improvements had higher levels of emotional distress at baseline.

CONCLUSIONS

1 year after completing a multimodal inpatient program adolescents report less chronic pain, disability, and emotional distress. Clinically significant changes remain stable. Adolescents with high levels of emotional distress at admission may require special attention to maintain positive treatment outcomes. Specialized inpatient therapy is effective for children with chronic pain.},

The quality of description of interventions in publications, however, is remarkably poor. To improve the completeness of reporting, and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide item selection, and a face to face panel meeting. The resultant 12 item TIDieR checklist (brief name, why, what (materials), what (procedure), who provided, how, where, when and how much, tailoring, modifications, how well (planned), how well (actual)) is an extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement (item 5) and the SPIRIT 2013 statement (item 11). While the emphasis of the checklist is on trials, the guidance is intended to apply across all evaluative study designs. This paper presents the TIDieR checklist and guide, with an explanation and elaboration for each item, and examples of good reporting. The TIDieR checklist and guide should improve the reporting of interventions and make it easier for authors to structure accounts of their interventions, reviewers and editors to assess the descriptions, and readers to use the information.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Pain-related disability affects many children and adolescents suffering from chronic pain and may exert an impact on all areas of their lives. Reduction of pain-related disability is, therefore, a fundamental aim of treatment; however, no validated means exist to assess pain-related disability in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to translate the Pediatric Pain Disability Index (P-PDI) of Varni into German and to investigate its psychometric qualities.

METHODS

Principal component and item analyses were conducted on outpatient (n=163) and inpatient samples (n=167) of adolescents suffering from chronic pain. Changes in pain-related disability 3 months after starting treatment were analysed in an outpatient sample of 110 adolescents. Correlations between pain-related disability, emotional variables and school absence as well as concordance with parents' ratings were investigated.

RESULTS

The P-PDI is a one-dimensional assessment tool with sufficient reliability. There were significant correlations between pain-related disability and pain intensity and school absence but not with pain duration, fear and depression. Parents and adolescents ratings correlated significantly, but 57{\%} of parents underestimated the pain-related disability of their children.

CONCLUSION

There is now a validated German version of the P-PDI to measure pain-related disability in adolescents suffering from chronic pain, which can be used in studies investigating treatment effectiveness.},

This study was designed to (1) provide information on the prevalence of pediatric pain as well as other pain related characteristics in a sample of schoolchildren, and (2) study the suitability of a system to grade the severity of chronic pain problems among children. Participants in this cross-sectional study included 561 schoolchildren between the ages of 8 and 16 years. Besides collecting information about the presence of pain at the time of interview, and in the preceding 3 months, several characteristics of participants' pain experiences and several indicators of participants' quality of life were requested. Results showed that 37.3{\%} had chronic pain, but only 5.1{\%} had moderate or severe chronic pain problems. Gender and age differences were found in the prevalence of pain conditions. Children who had a chronic pain condition reported a worse quality of life, missed more days from school, and were more likely to use pain medication and seek medical care for pain relief. Our study shows that chronic pain is a highly prevalent condition in the community, one that can exert negative consequence for the child. But the prevalence of severe chronic pain cases is low. New studies are needed to further empirically test the proposed method of grading the severity of chronic pain in children.

PERSPECTIVE

This article provides information on pain problems among schoolchildren. It also suggests a new grading system of chronic pediatric problems. This new system could help clinicians and researchers to diagnose pain problems in youth and design treatments suited to patients' characteristics and needs.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonrandomized pretest posttest with control group design was used. A battery of patient-oriented measures assessing pain interference, quality of life, and depressive symptoms were completed at treatment commencement and at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment by 44 youths enrolled in the IIPT and 138 youths engaged in the MMT, with various chronic pain conditions. Data were analyzed using longitudinal mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The main outcomes were the score difference from baseline of patient-oriented measures across 3 timepoints within 12 months of intervention initiation for both treatment groups. IIPT participants demonstrated greater improvement in pain interference, as compared with MMT at 3 and 12 months. Initially, health-related quality of life scores improved similarly in both groups, but greater improvement was seen in the MMT group at 12 months. Depressive symptom scores did not improve with either intervention. Only pain interference scores reached statistically and clinically significant difference levels. DISCUSSION: This study supports the benefits of specialized rehabilitation interventions, including both MMT and IIPT programs, for youths with chronic pain. The findings also suggest that IIPT might have a greater long-term effect for helping youths, in particular those with high pain interference scores.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Evaluating the variation in the strength of the effect across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is reflected by measures like \textgreek{t}(2) or I(2), but their clinical interpretation is not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in meta-analyses.

DESIGN

We show how the prediction interval can help understand the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95{\%} prediction intervals for them.

RESULTS

In 72.4{\%} of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p{\textless}0.05) meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database 2009-2013 with heterogeneity (I(2){\textgreater}0), the 95{\%} prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3{\%} of those 479 meta-analyses, the prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial.

CONCLUSIONS

The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat. Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative inferences in meta-analyses.},

@article{Irwin.2010,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) aims to develop self-reported item banks for clinical research. The PROMIS pediatrics (aged 8-17) project focuses on the development of item banks across several health domains (physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, social role relationships, and asthma symptoms). The psychometric properties of the anxiety and depressive symptom item banks are described.

METHODS

Participants (n = 1,529) were recruited in public school settings, hospital-based outpatient and subspecialty pediatrics clinics. The anxiety (k = 18) and depressive symptoms (k = 21) items were split between two test administration forms. Hierarchical confirmatory factor-analytic models (CFA) were conducted to evaluate scale dimensionality and local dependence. IRT analyses were then used to finalize item banks and short forms.

RESULTS

CFA results confirmed that anxiety and depressive symptoms are separate constructs and indicative of negative affect. Items with local dependence and DIF were removed resulting in 15 anxiety and 14 depressive symptoms items. The psychometric differences between short forms and simulated computer adaptive tests are presented.

CONCLUSIONS

PROMIS pediatric item banks were developed to provide efficient assessment of health-related quality of life domains. This sample provides initial calibrations of anxiety and depressive symptoms item banks and creates PROMIS pediatric instruments, version 1.0.},

Here, we examine a range of potential concerns about the widespread adoption of this method. Motivated by these issues, a variety of different conventions can be adopted when using the modified method in practice. We describe and investigate the use of a variety of these conventions using a new taxonomy of meta-analysis datasets. We conclude that the Hartung and Knapp modification may be a suitable replacement for the standard method. Despite this, analysts who advocate the modified method should be ready to defend its use against the possible objections to it that we present. We further recommend that the results from more conventional approaches should be used as sensitivity analyses when using the modified method. It has previously been suggested that a common-effect analysis should be used for this purpose but we suggest amending this recommendation and argue that a standard random-effects analysis should be used instead.},

@article{Jacobs.2020b,
 abstract = {Background and Objective

Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) have a substantially reduced

health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Their management should

preferably focus on multidisciplinary nonpharmacological interventions.

However, the long-term impact of such multicomponent therapies is not

fully established. Waiting lists for patients seeking medical treatment

are long, making individual-based approaches often unfeasible. The aim

of our pragmatic study was to evaluate long-term HRQoL benefits of a

comprehensive 8-week group-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation

program focusing on patients' coping ability and self-care. Methods

A total of 94 patients with clinically confirmed FM agreed to

participate in this study. Before entering the program based on

group-based cognitive behavioral therapy and graded activity training,

patients completed questionnaires to screen for comorbidities.

Health-related quality of life was assessed at the start, at 8 weeks, 6

months, and 1 year using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey

instrument. Changes in HRQoL scores were analyzed according to linear

mixed regression modeling. Results

Baseline findings confirmed the substantially low physical and mental

HRQoL in FM patients as well as high levels of depression, anxiety, and

burnout. Only 2 patients left the program prematurely; 89{\%} participated

in the 1-year assessment. By the end of the program, HRQoL was

significantly improved in all domains. This effect was maintained at 6

months and 1 year for all subscales. Changes at 1 year were greater in

younger patients and those with depressive feelings before the start of

treatment. Conclusions

Our group-based program offered to FM patients proved successful with

significant improvements in their HRQoL both in the short and long term.},

@article{Jacobs.2021,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) is effective in facilitating functional recovery in adolescents with chronic pain, engagement with IIPT is suboptimal among adolescents. A key aspect of IIPT is to support functional recovery via (re)engagement with age-appropriate daily activities. The aim of this study was to gain a comprehensive insight into adolescents' perceptions of the barriers they need to overcome to engage with age-appropriate activities in order to achieve functional recovery. METHODS: Forty-one adolescents who were starting an IIPT programme completed the 'passenger-on-the-bus metaphor', an exercise in which they identify and describe their perceived barriers (i.e. 'passengers' on their bus) that prevent them from engaging with age-appropriate activities. The responses were analysed using inductive thematic analyses to generate a taxonomy of perceived barriers to functional recovery. RESULTS: We generated a taxonomy of seven different barriers that participants described facing on their road to functional recovery: physical constraints, being 'fed up', low self-confidence and self-esteem, perfectionism, avoidance of engagement with pain, feelings (such as sadness, anger, guilt, anxiety) and social barriers (received from a range of sources such as parents, friends, school and wider society). CONCLUSION: The findings reveal a variety of barriers that were perceived to hinder functional recovery through reduced engagement with age-appropriate activities and thereby hamper progress within IIPT. The Passenger on the bus metaphor can be used to identify similar barriers faced by adolescents in an individualized treatment approach, thereby making it possible for clinicians to target their IIPT more precisely.},

@article{Janssen.2017,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

A validated measure of daytime sleepiness for adolescents is needed to better explore emerging relationships between sleepiness and the mental and physical health of adolescents. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a widely used scale for daytime sleepiness in adults but contains references to alcohol and driving. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS-CHAD) has been proposed as the official modified version of the ESS for children and adolescents. This study describes the psychometric analysis of the ESS-CHAD as a measure of daytime sleepiness for adolescents.

METHODS

The ESS-CHAD was completed by 297 adolescents, 12-18 years old, from two independent schools in Victoria, Australia. Exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the scale.

RESULTS

Exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis indicated that ESS-CHAD has internal validity and a unidimensional structure with good model fit. Rasch analysis of four subgroups based on gender and year-level were consistent with the overall results. The results were consistent with published ESS results, which strongly indicates that the changes to the scale do not affect the scale's capacity to measure daytime sleepiness.

CONCLUSIONS

It is concluded that the ESS-CHAD is a reliable and internally valid measure of daytime sleepiness in adolescents 12-18 years old. Further studies are needed to establish the internal validity of the ESS-CHAD for children under 12 years, and to establish external validity and accurate cut-off points for children and adolescents.},

 abstract = {A meta-analysis examining temporal changes (time trends) in the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment for unipolar depression was conducted. A comprehensive search of psychotherapy trials yielded 70 eligible studies from 1977 to 2014. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified as Hedge's g based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Rates of remission were also registered. The publication year of each study was examined as a linear metaregression predictor of ES, and as part of a 2-way interaction with other moderators (Year $\times$ Moderator). The average ES of the BDI was 1.58 (95{\%} CI [1.43, 1.74]), and 1.69 for the HRSD (95{\%} CI [1.48, 1.89]). Subgroup analyses revealed that women profited more from therapy than did men (p {\textless} .05). Experienced psychologists (g = 1.55) achieved better results (p {\textless} .01) than less experienced student therapists (g = 0.98). The metaregressions examining the temporal trends indicated that the effects of CBT have declined linearly and steadily since its introduction, as measured by patients' self-reports (the BDI, p {\textless} .001), clinicians' ratings (the HRSD, p {\textless} .01) and rates of remission (p {\textless} .01). Subgroup analyses confirmed that the declining trend was present in both within-group (pre/post) designs (p {\textless} .01) and controlled trial designs (p = .02). Thus, modern CBT clinical trials seemingly provided less relief from depressive symptoms as compared with the seminal trials. Potential causes and possible implications for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{Kachko.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

Chronic pain in children and adolescents is common, but proportion of neuropathic pain (NP), a heterogeneous group of diseases with major impact on health-related quality of life, significant economic burden, and limited treatment options, is unclear. Many studies have focused only on complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Our aim was to examine the incidence, clinical features, management, and outcome of non-CRPS NP in patients referred to a chronic pediatric pain clinic (CPPC) at a tertiary-care hospital.

METHODS

Retrospective analyses of the patient's files with non-CRPS NP from 2008 until 2012.

RESULTS

Twenty patients (9.9-22.0~years; 10.7{\%} of new referrals) were treated with non-CRPS NP (postoperative 8/20, trauma-related 5/20, disease-related 7/20). The number of consultations performed and the number of medications used before CPPC were significantly higher than in CPPC (Z~=~0.75, P~=~0.005; Z~=~1.68, P~=~0.003; respectively, Wilcoxon test). The number of diagnostic procedures was not statistically significant. Invasive treatments were used in 50{\%} of patients. Full/partial recovery was accomplished in 95{\%}. anova with repeated measures yielded a highly significant difference between the initial and final visual analog scale (VAS) scores (8.2~$\pm$~1.3; 1.19~$\pm$~2.01, respectively; P~{\textless}~0.001), and no effect of age, gender, time needed for referral to CPPC, and patient's categories on the change in VAS.

CONCLUSIONS

Better understanding of the medical profile of pediatric patients with non-CRPS NP is crucial to timely and correct diagnosis and effective management, but even children with delayed diagnosis still have a good outcome. The management of this condition by an experienced team is recommended.},

To describe school absences in adolescents with Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) and examine the relationship between school absenteeism, pain, psychiatric symptoms, and maternal pain history.

METHODS

Adolescents with JPFS (N = 102; mean age 14.96 years) completed measures of pain and depressive symptoms, and completed a psychiatric interview. Parents provided information about the adolescents' school absences, type of schooling, and parental pain history. School attendance reports were obtained directly from schools.

RESULTS

Over 12{\%} of adolescents with JPFS were homeschooled. Those enrolled in regular school missed 2.9 days per month on average, with one-third of participants missing more than 3 days per month. Pain and maternal pain history were not related to school absenteeism. However, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with school absences.

CONCLUSION

Many adolescents with JPFS experience difficulties with regular school attendance. Long-term risks associated with school absenteeism and the importance of addressing psychological factors are discussed.},

 abstract = {Objective

Parental factors are central in the development and maintenance of chronic pain in youths. Only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of psychological treatments for pediatric chronic pain on parental factors, and the relationships between changes in parental and adolescent factors. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of an intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for adolescents with chronic pain, on adolescent and parental variables, and the relationship between parental psychological flexibility and adolescent pain acceptance.

Methods

Adolescents (N = 164) with chronic pain were included, with a mean age of 15.5 years, and completed the 3-week treatment with an accompanying parent (N = 164). Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze change over time (from pretreatment to 3-month follow-up) on parent (depression, health-related quality of life and parent psychological flexibility) and adolescent (physical, social and emotional functioning, and adolescent pain acceptance) variables. Additionally, linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the relationship between parent psychological flexibility and adolescent pain acceptance.

Results

Results illustrated significant improvements over time in depressive symptoms and levels of psychological flexibility in parents. Excluding social development, adolescents improved significantly in all assessed aspects of functioning and pain acceptance. Additionally, changes in parent psychological flexibility were significantly associated with changes in adolescent pain acceptance.

Conclusions

Results indicated that treatment had positive effects for parents and adolescents, and a significant positive relationship between changes in parent psychological flexibility and adolescent pain acceptance was found.},

@article{Kempert.2017,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To determine whether patient-reported measures would be clinically sensitive and useful for identifying functional change within an intensive chronic pain program setting by examining 2 patient-reported measures administered as part of physical and occupational therapy for chronic pain.

DESIGN

A retrospective data analysis of children and adolescents with chronic pain treated over a single calendar year. Paired t tests evaluated change in perceived function measures and pain over time. Standardized residual change scores were used in subsequent regression to assess associations between change scores.

SETTING

An interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation program that supports children and adolescents with chronic pain by increasing strength, flexibility, and endurance; facilitating a return to daily life activities; and using appropriate self-directed coping and pain management skills.

PARTICIPANTS

Children and adolescents (N=109; age range, 8-19y; 83{\%} girls) with various chronic pain diagnoses who were admitted to a 3- to 4-week intensive pain rehabilitation program.

INTERVENTIONS

Participants were involved in physical and occupational therapy for 3 hours daily, as well as recreation therapy, psychology, school, aquatics, art therapy, and music therapy for a total of 8 hours daily. Parents were involved in parent education with therapists from all disciplines in conjunction with their child's programming.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI), and self-reported pain severity rating on 0-to-10 numerical rating scale.

RESULTS

Data demonstrated significant gains in LEFS and UEFI during the program. Improvement in perceived functioning was significantly correlated with a reduction in pain.

CONCLUSIONS

The LEFS and UEFI provide a meaningful way to track progress in chronic pain rehabilitation. Using self-perceived measures, children and adolescents noted significant functional improvement, associated with less pain intensity. These findings increase our understanding of the rehabilitation process and point to goals for clinical improvement.},

collected. Results: Qualitative outcomes provided valuable data about

distractions and benefits. Quantitative outcomes showed that there were

significant improvements in areas such as mental tension, emotional

tension, muscle tension, and pain (all P {\textless} 0.001 significant).

Conclusion: Pediatric chronic pain patients can identify many benefits

after a single group yoga session. It combines the physical and

Studies of pain prevalence rates in children and adolescents published in English or French between 1991 and 2009 were identified using EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Of 185 published papers yielded by the search, 58 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed, and 41 were included in the review. Two independent reviewers screened papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of studies. Prevalence rates ranged substantially, and were as follows: headache: 8-83{\%}; abdominal pain: 4-53{\%}; back pain: 14-24{\%}; musculoskeletal pain: 4-40{\%}; multiple pains: 4-49{\%}; other pains: 5-88{\%}. Pain prevalence rates were generally higher in girls and increased with age for most pain types. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher pain prevalence especially for headache. Most studies did not meet quality criteria.},

 abstract = {AIM

To examine and compare the presenting characteristics and the change in the physical and psychosocial functioning of adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or somatoform disorders who have received an adaptable multidisciplinary intervention over a 12-month period.

METHODS

Fifty adolescents presenting to the Complex Adolescent Clinic at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia were assessed. Their physical and psychosocial functioning was rated by the adolescents and their parents using the Child Health Questionnaire. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4 months and 12 months after initiating treatment. Analyses examined whether diagnosis and/or illness precipitants were related to treatment outcome.

RESULTS

Adolescents with both CFS and somatoform disorders demonstrated improvement in physical and psychosocial functioning over the first 4 months of treatment, sustained at 12-month follow-up. A diagnosis of CFS was associated with poorer physical functioning over time and a trend towards a longer illness time course compared with somatoform disorder. Adjustment for a physical precipitant reduced the association between diagnosis and physical functioning. Those who had a physical precipitant to their illness had significantly poorer physical functioning over time than those who did not, regardless of diagnostic category. Diagnosis and physical precipitant were not associated with psychosocial functioning.

CONCLUSIONS

Improvement in adolescent physical and psychosocial functioning over time suggests that a multidisciplinary treatment model may be effective for varied complex medico-psychosocial presentations, irrespective of diagnosis and illness precipitant. Illness precipitant may have a greater influence on treatment outcome than diagnostic category.},

@article{Konning.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Prevalence estimates of severe chronic pain in pediatric community samples are rare and inconclusive. This study aimed to (1) examine the prevalence of chronic pain severity grades in school children and (2) investigate differences between pain severity grades for pain-related characteristics, including pain locations, sociodemographic characteristics, emotional functioning, insomnia, school factors, and health care utilization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This cross-sectional observational study was conducted with 2220 school students in Germany (52{\%} female individuals, age: M=13.0; SD=1.8; range, 10 to 18 y). Pain severity was assessed using the validated Chronic Pain Grades for adolescents. Comparisons between Chronic Pain Grade subgroups of adolescent characteristics were conducted using \textgreek{q}2 tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and 1-way analysis of variance.

RESULTS

In school students, 31.0{\%} had chronic pain with 8.2{\%} categorized as severe. Individuals with higher pain severity tended to be girls and have multisite pain, more symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and a higher emotional burden of pain. Individuals with higher pain severity also reported less school satisfaction, lower perceived school performance, and more insomnia. Pain medication intake and physician visits because of pain were more common in those with more severe pain.

DISCUSSION

Severe chronic pain affects nearly 1 in 10 adolescent school students and is associated with several negative health outcomes and increased health care utilization. It is important to ensure that specialized pain treatment programs are available to these students and that they are aware of the different negative health outcomes associated with the pain condition.},

This report examined limitations in our ability to assess clinically significant change (CSC) in randomized controlled trials of treatments of self-reported pediatric chronic pain intensity.

METHODS

The following were reviewed: (a) approaches to assessing CSC; (b) approaches to assessing CSC used in psychological treatment studies of self-reported pediatric chronic pain intensity included in a recent systematic review; (c) the role of test-retest reliability in distribution-based CSC measures; (d) the test-retest reliability of recommended chronic pain measures.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Existing studies do not assess whether a CSC occurred or use procedures that did not account for measurement error and true score fluctuations unrelated to treatment, possibly resulting in overestimating CSCs. Distribution-based approaches to assessing CSCs that address these problems require knowing test-retest reliability of the chronic pain measure at appropriate intervals. Available information raises concern about our ability to estimate CSC reliably. Recommendations are made for future research.},

To adapt problem-solving skills training (PSST) for parents of children receiving intensive pain rehabilitation and evaluate treatment feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction.

Methods

Using a prospective single-arm case series design, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering PSST to 26 parents (84.6{\%} female) from one of three pediatric pain rehabilitation programs.

Results

Parents completed four to six sessions of PSST delivered during a 2-4-week period. A mixed-methods approach was used to assess treatment acceptability and satisfaction. We also assessed changes in parent mental health and behavior outcomes from pretreatment to immediate posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Parents demonstrated excellent treatment adherence and rated the intervention as highly acceptable and satisfactory. Preliminary analyses indicated improvements in domains of mental health, parenting behaviors, health status, and problem-solving skills.

Conclusions

Findings demonstrate the potential role of psychological interventions directed at reducing parent distress in the context of intensive pediatric pain rehabilitation.},

@article{Lee.2020b,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Pediatric chronic pain has often been examined from a risk perspective, and relatively less is known about the individual and family-level resilience factors that help youth with chronic pain maintain their quality of life (QOL). This cross-sectional study: (1) examined the relations among purported youth and parent resilience (youth pain acceptance and pain self-efficacy, parent psychological flexibility) and risk (youth pain intensity and parent protectiveness) factors with youth QOL, and (2) tested exploratory statistical mechanisms that may explain relations between parent and youth variables.

METHODS

Participants included 122 youth (10 to 17 y; M=14.26, SD=2.19) seen in an interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain program and a parent. Youth completed measures of their average pain, QOL, pain acceptance, and pain self-efficacy. Parents completed measures of their pain-related psychological flexibility and behavioral responses to pain (ie, protectiveness, distraction, monitoring, minimizing).

RESULTS

Youth pain acceptance, pain self-efficacy, and parent psychological flexibility were highly positively correlated with each other, and with overall youth QOL. Evidence for a buffering effect of pain acceptance and pain self-efficacy on the association between pain intensity and QOL was not found. Protectiveness was found to be a significant mediator of the relation between parental psychological flexibility and youth QOL.

DISCUSSION

The results are discussed in the context of the resilience-risk framework and current understandings of the role of parental factors for pediatric chronic pain.},

@article{Lee.2021,
 abstract = {Background: Caregiving for a youth with chronic pain is associated with unique stressors. Parents can play important roles for youth coping and functional outcomes, although parents often report uncertainty about how to support their youth and may benefit from learning evidence-based strategies. However, few parent-targeted interventions for pediatric chronic pain exist, particularly delivered within a group format. Objectives: The aims of this study were to describe the development of a parent-targeted group intervention within an outpatient interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain clinic and to assess preliminary feasibility and effectiveness. Method: The development and content of the intervention are described in detail. Feasibility was assessed via enrollment, attendance, and attrition. Effectiveness was assessed via parent self-reported responses to pain and psychological flexibility (PF) before and after treatment. Results: Seventy parents consented and participated in the 5-week group intervention (2 hr/session). Preliminary results demonstrated adequate feasibility, with attendance rates at 61.4{\%} and attrition rates at 24.3{\%}. After treatment, there were significant moderate- to large-sized decreases in 3 of 4 parent behaviors assessed (protectiveness, monitoring, minimizing) and large-sized increases in PF. Conclusions: This group intervention for parents can produce positive changes in self-reported parent behavior and PF and may be a feasible way to intervene within an outpatient interdisciplinary setting.

Impact Statement

Implications for Impact Statement-Parents play important roles for supporting coping and functional outcomes in youth with chronic pain, although parents report uncertainty over how to best support their youth and may benefit from learning evidence-based strategies. This study suggests that a relatively brief parent-targeted group intervention (5 weeks, 2 hr/week) may help promote psychological flexibility and reduce unhelpful parent behaviours that may reinforce pain.

@article{Lin.2019,
 abstract = {Assessing publication bias is a critical procedure in meta-analyses for rating the synthesized overall evidence. Because statistical tests for publication bias are usually not powerful and only give P values that inform either the presence or absence of the bias, examining the asymmetry of funnel plots has been popular to investigate potentially missing studies and the direction of the bias. Most funnel plots present treatment effects against their standard errors, and the contours depicting studies' significance levels have been used in the plots to distinguish publication bias from other factors (such as heterogeneity and subgroup effects) that may cause the plots' asymmetry. However, treatment effects and their standard errors are frequently associated even if no publication bias exists (eg, both variables depend on the four data cells in a 2~$\times$~2 table for the odds ratio), so standard-error-based funnel plots may lead to false positive conclusions when such association may not be negligible. In addition, the missingness of studies may relate to their sample sizes besides P values (which are partly determined by standard errors); studies with more samples are more likely published. Therefore, funnel plots based on sample sizes can be an alternative tool. However, the contours for standard-error-based funnel plots cannot be directly applied to sample-size-based ones. This article introduces contours for sample-size-based funnel plots of various effect sizes, which may help meta-analysts properly interpret such plots' asymmetry. We provide five examples to illustrate the use of the proposed contours.},

@article{Linden.2013,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Empirical research on the negative effects of psychotherapy is insufficient, partly because there is a lack of theoretical concept on how to define, classify and assess psychotherapy side effects. This paper proposes a model for the definition, classification and assessment of psychotherapy side effects.

METHOD

Definitions are provided for 'unwanted events', 'treatment-emergent reactions', 'adverse treatment reactions', 'malpractice reactions', 'treatment non-response', 'deterioration of illness', 'therapeutic risks' and 'contraindications'. We describe processes analysing the causality of negative events and the correctness of treatment.

RESULT

A procedural model on how to find, classify and evaluate negative events is described, the unwanted event to adverse treatment reaction (UE-ATR) checklist.

CONCLUSION

Recognition of adverse treatment effects is a characteristic of good therapists and treatments. Psychotherapists should be sensitive for negative effects. This can help improve the quality of treatment. The UE-ATR checklist can be used in psychotherapy trials, quality assurance, clinical practice and training of psychotherapists.},

@article{Liossi.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Paediatric chronic pain is a significant problem that can have devastating impacts on quality of life. Multimodal interdisciplinary interventions are the mainstay of paediatric treatment. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of interdisciplinary interventions in the management of paediatric chronic pain.

METHODS

Studies were identified via a search of nine databases. The search strategy included concept blocks pertaining to type of pain, study population, and type of intervention. Eligible studies reported the effects of an intervention co-ordinated by two or more healthcare professionals of different disciplines, and recruited a sample aged 22 yr or below with chronic pain. Twenty-eight studies were included, and 21 provided data for inclusion in between- and within-groups meta-analyses.

RESULTS

Patients randomised to interdisciplinary interventions reported significantly lower pain intensity 0-1 month post-intervention compared with patients randomised to the control groups. Within-groups analysis of patients receiving interdisciplinary interventions showed significant improvements pre- to post-intervention in pain intensity, functional disability, anxiety, depression, catastrophising, school attendance, school functioning, and pain acceptance. Few differences were found between interventions delivered in inpatient vs outpatient settings. Significant heterogeneity due mainly to differing outcome variables and intervention content was found in most analyses.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, interdisciplinary interventions show promise in providing a range of clinical benefits for children with chronic pain. Methodologically robust randomised controlled trials using standardised outcome measures are needed, however, to guide clinical care.},

We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject $\times$ condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor ($\surd$2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

@article{Logan.2012,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To examine clinical outcomes of an interdisciplinary day-hospital treatment program (comprised of physical, occupational, and cognitive-behavioral therapies with medical and nursing services) for pediatric complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

METHODS

The study is a longitudinal case series of consecutive patients treated in a day-hospital pediatric pain rehabilitation program. Participants were 56 children and adolescents with ages 8 to 18 years (median=14 y) with CRPS spectrum conditions who failed to progress sufficiently with a previous outpatient and/or inpatient treatments. Patients participated in daily physical therapy, occupational therapy, and psychological treatment and received nursing and medical care as necessary. The model places equal emphasis on physical and cognitive-behavioral approaches to pain management. Median duration of stay was 3 weeks. Outcome measures included assessments of physical, occupational, and psychological functioning at program admission, discharge, and at posttreatment follow-up at a median of 10 months after discharge. Scores at discharge and follow-up were compared with measures on admission by Wilcoxon tests, paired t tests, or analysis of variance as appropriate, with corrections for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS

Outcomes demonstrate clinically and statistically significant improvements from admission to discharge in pain intensity (P{\textless}0.001), functional disability (P{\textless}0.001), subjective report of limb function (P{\textless}0.001), timed running (P{\textless}0.001), occupational performance (P{\textless}0.001), medication use (P{\textless}0.01), use of assistive devices (P{\textless}0.001), and emotional functioning (anxiety, P{\textless}0.001; depression, P{\textless}0.01). Functional gains were maintained or further improved at follow-up.

DISCUSSION

A day-hospital interdisciplinary rehabilitation approach seems effective in reducing disability and improving physical and emotional functioning and occupational performance among children and adolescents with CRPSs that have failed to improve with outpatient treatment.},

 abstract = {Sleep behaviors play an important role in the experience of chronic pain in adolescence; less well known is the effect of improved sleep in the context of pain rehabilitation. This study examined changes in sleep habits and their association with pain and functioning following day-hospital interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation. Participants (84{\%} female) were a cohort of 274 youth (ages 10-18, mean age 14.6 years) with neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain and associated disability who completed measures at admission, discharge, and short term (1-3 month) follow-up. Parents reported on the child's sleep habits; participants reported on pain, functional disability, and school functioning. Results show that sleep habits improved over the course of intensive pain rehabilitation treatment, with continued improvements at follow-up. Sleep habits at discharge correlated with concurrent measures of functional disability and mood symptoms, with healthier sleep habits being associated with less disability and fewer mood symptoms. Furthermore, greater sleep duration, less sleep onset delay, and fewer night wakings correlated with lower pain intensity ratings at discharge. Controlling for change in pain with treatment, baseline sleep habits, age, and concurrent depressive symptoms, sleep habits at discharge predicted global functioning and school functioning measured at follow-up. There was modest support for changes in sleep habits over the course of treatment predicting pain reduction at follow-up, with decreased night wakings significantly predicting reduced pain intensity at follow-up. Improvements in sleep habits may be one mechanism of efficacy for intensive pediatric pain rehabilitation.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare children and adolescents with overlapping chronic pains (OCP) to those with single chronic pains (SCP) among youth presenting in specialized clinical settings, in an effort to identify potential risk factors for developing overlapping pains. METHODS: A total of 1235 youth ages 8 to 18 seen in a tertiary care multidisciplinary pain clinic or a multidisciplinary headache clinic completed self-report measures of pain, disability, psychological functioning and clinical history and characteristics at the time of initial clinic visit. Information was captured in a chronic pain data repository and accessed for the current study. RESULTS: Subsequent pain symptoms developed on average 11.9 months (SD=24.5 mo) after onset of the first pain symptom. Compared with patients with SCP, patients with OCP report more medical comorbidity, more developmental issues, and poorer current sleep and school functioning. They also scored significantly higher than patients with SCP on self-reported functional disability, pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, depression, anxiety, and psychological stress and lower quality of life (all Ps{\textless}0.001). In multivariate analysis, variables most strongly associated with presenting with OCP were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.1, P{\textless}0.001), having a clinically significant high functional disability (OR: 1.4, P=0.3), and low quality of life (OR: 2.5, P{\textless}0.001). DISCUSSION: Given their tendency toward more psychological and medical comorbidities, patients with OCP may require more intense and diverse treatment approaches. Some early life experiences may be a risk factor for development of OCP. Longitudinal studies are needed to fully evaluate the heightened risk for OCP associated with some of these factors.},

@article{LopezLumbi.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain in children and adolescents gives rise to high health care costs. Successful treatment is supposed to reduce the economic burden. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in health care utilization and expenditures from one year before (Pre) intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) to the first (Post 1) and second (Post 2) years after discharge in a sample of pediatric chronic pain patients. METHODS: Claims data from one statutory health insurance company were analyzed for 119 children and adolescents (mean age = 15.3, 68.9{\%} female) who sought IIPT at the German Pediatric Pain Centre. Costs incurred for inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, medication, remedies and aids were compared before treatment and two years after discharge. Health care utilization was compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and expenditures using trimmed means and the Yuen's t-test. RESULTS: Overall costs were significantly lower in the two years after IIPT compared to before IIPT (Pre: 3543{\text\euro}, Post 1: 2681{\text\euro}, Post 2: 1937{\text\euro} (trimmed means)). Health care utilization changed significantly; hospitalizations decreased in the years after discharge, while psychotherapies stayed stable in the year after discharge but lessened in the second year. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support prior findings on the high economic burden of pediatric chronic pain. IIPT may contribute to a transition in health care utilization from somatic-focused treatments to more psychological treatments. Overall costs were reduced as soon as the first year after discharge and decreased even further in the second year.},

To study prevalence changes of self-reported pain, sleep problems, and fatigue among 8-year-old children, and to examine the co-occurrence and associated psychosocial variables of these symptoms.

METHODS

3 cross-sectional representative samples were compared in 1989, 1999, and 2005. The frequency of headache, abdominal pain, other pains, sleep problems, and fatigue were studied. In addition, sociodemographic information and child's psychiatric problems were inquired.

RESULTS

The prevalence of abdominal pain, sleep problems, and fatigue, in addition to headache in boys and other pains in girls increased significantly (p {\textless} .05) from 1989 to 2005, with cumulative odds ratio (95{\%} confidence intervals) varying from 1.6 (1.2-2.1) to 2.4 (1.7-3.3). All symptoms were associated with each other and with the child's psychiatric problems. However, psychiatric problems did not explain the observed increase in the symptom frequencies.

CONCLUSIONS

Finnish children's self-reported pain, sleep problems, and fatigue have increased remarkably. Studies providing information on the causes and prevention possibilities are warranted.},

@article{Mahrer.2018,
 abstract = {Chronic pain is characterized by high rates of functional impairment, health care utilization, and associated costs. Research supports the use of comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment approaches. However, many hospitals hesitate to offer this full range of services, especially to Medi-Cal/Medicaid patients whose services are reimbursed at low rates. This cost analysis examines the effect on hospital and insurance costs of patients' enrollment in an interdisciplinary pediatric pain clinic, which includes medication management, psychotherapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, and massage. Retrospective hospital billing data (inpatient/emergency department/outpatient visits, and associated costs/reimbursement) from 191 consecutively enrolled Medi-Cal/Medicaid pediatric patients with chronic pain were used to compare 1-year costs before initiating pain clinic services with costs 1 year after. Pain clinic patients had significantly fewer emergency department visits, fewer inpatient stays, and lower associated billing, compared with the year before without interdisciplinary pain management services. Cost savings to the hospital of {\$}36,228 per patient per year and to insurance of {\$}11,482 per patient per year were found even after pain clinic service billing was included. Analyses of pre-pain clinic costs indicate that these cost reductions were likely because of clinic participation. Findings provide economic support for the use of interdisciplinary care to treat pediatric chronic pain on an outpatient basis from a hospital and insurance perspective.

PERSPECTIVE

This article presents a cost analysis of an interdisciplinary pediatric pain outpatient clinic. Findings support the incorporation of a comprehensive treatment approach that can reduce costs from a hospital and insurance perspective over the course of just 1 year.},

Using a longitudinal design with a two-year follow-up, two-week IIPT resulted in sustainable improvements in mean and maximum pain intensity, physical functioning and internalization and reductions in the mean number of medical visits, school absence and frequency of pain medication at year 2 following IIPT. While pain-related disability scores did not improve, problem-focused coping became more prevalent, and patient and parent-assessed satisfaction as well as pain experience continued to improve throughout the study. Our results demonstrate that a two-week IIPT with a booster confers meaningful short- and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes and resource utilization among paediatric patients with severe chronic pain.},

The dilemma of which effect-size estimate is suitable is still a problem in meta-analysis. Monte Carlo simulations were used to generate random variables from a normal distribution or contaminated normal distribution for primary studies. The primary studies were hypothesised to have equal variance under different population effect sizes. The primary studies were also hypothesised to have unequal variance. Meta-analysis was done on the simulated hypothesized-primary-studies. The effect sizes for the simulated design of the primary studies were estimated using Cohen's d, Hedges' g, Glass' $\bigtriangleup$, Cliff's delta d and the Probability of Superiority. Their corresponding standard error and confidence interval were computed and a comparison of an efficient estimator was done using statistical bias, percentage error and confidence interval width. The statistical bias, percentage error and confidence interval width pointed to Probability of Superiority as an accurate effect size estimate under contaminated normal distribution, and Hedges' g as the most accurate effect size estimates compared to Cohen's d and Glass' $\bigtriangleup$ when equal variance assumptions are violated. This study suggests that the accuracy of effect size estimates depends on the details of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Social deprivation is associated with a higher prevalence of chronic pain in children and an under-representation in specialist paediatric chronic pain programs. Our primary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between social deprivation and paediatric chronic pain referrals in Ireland. Secondary objectives included analysing for differences between deprivation groups in pain characteristics and function that are recorded at first clinic visit. METHODS: Families attending the national paediatric complex pain service in Dublin, Ireland, complete questionnaires on pain characteristics, parental pain catastrophizing, and pain-related disability including sleep quality and school attendance. We retrospectively reviewed records from between February 2016 and November 2019 on 288 patients. Social deprivation was assessed using the Pobal HP Deprivation Index, which is based on data from the Irish national census. RESULTS: Referrals followed a normal distribution across deprivation grades. Children in the disadvantaged group had a longer duration of pain, greater use of screens at bedtime, and longer sleep onset latency. Parents in the disadvantaged group had significantly higher levels of parental pain catastrophizing. CONCLUSIONS: In Ireland, while paediatric chronic pain referrals were normally distributed across deprivation group, the disadvantaged group was different in several ways that may be clinically significant. Further work will be needed to determine the longitudinal relationship between these factors before and after the referral and initial review. Screening for, and targeting, potential risk factors for pain chronicity may be needed to harmonize treatment outcomes in children from socially disadvantaged families.},

To classify paediatric chronic pain referrals in Ireland using the ICD-11 classification. In addition, differences between primary and secondary pain groups were assessed.

METHODS

Retrospective review of complex pain assessment forms completed at the time of initial attendance at paediatric chronic pain clinics in Dublin, Ireland. Patients were classified as having a chronic primary (CPP) or chronic secondary (CSP) pain condition as per ICD-11 classification. Secondary analysis of between-group and within-group differences between primary and secondary pain conditions was undertaken.

RESULTS

Of 285 patients coded, 123 patients were designated as having a CPP condition (77{\%} of which were assigned an adjunct parent code) and 162 patients as having a CSP condition (61{\%} of which were assigned an adjunct parent code). Between-group comparisons found that the lowest reported pain scores were higher in CPP than CSP conditions. In the CSP group, there were stronger correlations between parental pain catastrophizing and pain intensity, school attendance, and pain interference with social activities, than in the CPP group.

CONCLUSIONS

The majority of children with both CPP and CSP were assigned multiple parent codes. There appears to be a gradient in the differences in biopsychosocial profile between CPP and CSP conditions. Additional field testing of the ICD-11 classification in paediatric chronic pain will be required.},

Nevertheless, a minority of studies have failed to replicate this effect. This article attempts to resolve the inconsistent results by introducing a novel variant of proponent-skeptic collaboration. The proposed approach combines the features of adversarial collaboration and purely confirmatory preregistered research. Prior to data collection, the adversaries reached consensus on an optimal research design, formulated their expectations, and agreed to submit the findings to an academic journal regardless of the outcome. To increase transparency and secure the purely confirmatory nature of the investigation, the 2 parties set up a publicly available adversarial collaboration agreement that detailed the proposed design and all foreseeable aspects of the data analysis. As anticipated by the skeptics, a series of Bayesian hypothesis tests indicated that horizontal eye movements did not improve free recall performance. The skeptics suggested that the nonreplication may partly reflect the use of suboptimal and questionable research practices in earlier eye movement studies. The proponents countered this suggestion and used a p curve analysis to argue that the effect of horizontal eye movements on explicit memory did not merely reflect selective reporting.},

A biopsychosocial model was used to treat pain-associated disability in children and adolescents. We assessed the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents (8-21 years of age) with pain-associated disability who were treated in an interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation program which included physical, occupational, and recreational therapy, medicine, nursing, pediatric psychology, neuropsychology, psychiatry, social work, and education. Psychological treatment emphasized cognitive-behavioral intervention for pain and anxiety management, and behavioral shaping to increase functioning.

METHODS

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 41 consecutive patients. School attendance, sleep, and medication usage were assessed at admission and discharge; functional disability and physical mobility were assessed at admission, discharge, and 3-month follow-up.

RESULTS

As a group, significant improvements were observed in school status, sleep, functional ability, physical mobility, and medication usage.

 abstract = {It is important to understand the processes that contribute to disability and distress in adolescents with chronic pain. For example, research has identified that when adolescents can positively adapt to the consequences of health condition, rather than attempt to change the condition itself, they also function better and experience less distress. This pattern of behavior is similar to what is referred to as {\textquotedbl}acceptance{\textquotedbl} of pain in the adult literature. Although acceptance is consistently associated with positive outcomes in adult studies, there has been less investigation of acceptance in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the reliability and validity of an adolescent-adapted version of the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-A), and, using this instrument, to carry out a preliminary investigation of acceptance in adolescents with chronic pain. A sample of 122 highly disabled adolescents with chronic pain attending a specialty service completed the adapted CPAQ-A. They also completed standardized measures of their pain and daily functioning. Results supported the reliability and validity of the CPAQ-A. Correlation analyses showed that higher levels of acceptance were associated with lower levels of distress and disability, but not with lower pain intensity. Regression analyses were carried out to assess the independent contribution of acceptance after pain intensity and demographic variables were taken into account. In these analyses acceptance accounted for significant variance in disability, psychological distress, and developmental and family functioning. We discuss developmental aspects of acceptance in adolescents and clinical implications of these findings.},

 abstract = {UNLABELLED

Under the auspices of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), 26 professionals from academia, governmental agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry participated in a 2-stage Delphi poll and a consensus meeting that identified core outcome domains and measures that should be considered in clinical trials of treatments for acute and chronic pain in children and adolescents. Consensus was refined by consultation with the international pediatric pain community through announcement of our recommendations on the Pediatric Pain List and inviting and incorporating comments from external sources. There was consensus that investigators conducting pediatric acute pain clinical trials should consider assessing outcomes in pain intensity; global judgment of satisfaction with treatment; symptoms and adverse events; physical recovery; emotional response; and economic factors. There was also agreement that investigators conducting pediatric clinical trials in chronic and recurrent pain should consider assessing outcomes in pain intensity; physical functioning; emotional functioning; role functioning; symptoms and adverse events; global judgment of satisfaction with treatment; sleep; and economic factors. Specific measures or measurement strategies were recommended for different age groups for each domain.

PERSPECTIVE

Based on systematic review and consensus of experts, core domains and measures for clinical trials to treat pain in children and adolescents were defined. This will assist in comparison and pooling of data and promote evidence-based treatment, encourage complete reporting of outcomes, simplify the review of proposals and manuscripts, and facilitate clinicians making informed decisions regarding treatment.},

This observational study was conducted to describe the demographics and various descriptors, complementary medicine therapy (CMT) use, and lifestyle factors (i.e., food habits and supplement use) of pediatric patients with chronic pain. Methods: Boston Medical Center's Interdisciplinary Pediatric Pain Clinic provides patient education and unique treatment plans, tailored with medical and nonpharmacologic interventions for managing complex and chronic pain. Patient data were obtained through electronic medical chart review and self-reported surveys, and were completed by participants and parents at enrollment. Results: Of the 83 participants, the average age was 15.4 $\pm$ 4.3, and 80{\%} were female. Referrals to the clinic were due to abdominal pain (52{\%}), headache (23{\%}), and musculoskeletal or other pain (25{\%}). Thirty-one percent were on food assistance programs, with only 24{\%} of patients currently using CMTs and 85{\%} using pain medications. More than half of all participants (63{\%}) missed up to 5 days of school in the past year, while 26{\%} missed more than 6 days. School or academics (77{\%}) were the most frequently self-reported stressor, followed by social/peer issues (39{\%}), bullying (18{\%}), and parental stress (18{\%}). A very small proportion of patients had sufficient intake of dairy (12{\%}), water (23{\%}), vegetables (1{\%}), and fruits (22{\%}). Conclusion: Chronic pain can significantly affect lifestyle factors, stress, and child development. Patients evaluated at the clinic had poor diets and report having stressors regarding school, social/peer issues, parental stress, and bullying.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition of a limb characterized by a constellation of symptoms. Little is known about the clinical features of pediatric CRPS, with fewer than a dozen studies published to date. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical course of pediatric CRPS, with emphasis on clinical features and disease outcomes. A secondary aim was to discern differences in clinical features of pediatric CRPS with and without related movement disorders, and between children who had a favorable and unfavorable outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We carried out a retrospective chart review of children with CRPS who presented to a pediatric Chronic Pain Clinic in Canada over a 5-year period (2012 to 2016).

RESULTS

The study identified 59 children with CRPS (mean age: 12.7$\pm$2.5; 74.6{\%} female; 72.9{\%} lower extremity). In total, 87{\%} (n=48) of children experienced complete resolution or significant improvement of CRPS, with a relapse rate of 15{\%}. Overall, 25{\%} (n=15) had a CRPS-related movement disorder. There were no differences in the clinical features of pediatric CRPS with or without related movement disorders. Children who experienced a favorable outcome had a significantly shorter symptom duration at the initial visit in comparison with children who experienced an unfavorable outcome.

DISCUSSION

In this cohort, pediatric CRPS was most common in girls around the age of 12, usually in the lower extremity, and most experienced a favorable outcome. Further research is needed to better understand the prognosis and relapse rate of pediatric CRPS.},

@article{Messerer.2014,
 abstract = {Non-pharmaceutical procedures are increasingly being used in pediatric pain therapy in addition to pharmaceutical procedures and have a supporting function. This article describes the non-pharmaceutical procedures which have an influence on perioperative and posttraumatic pain in children and adolescents. Prerequisites for every adequate pain therapy are affection, imparting a feeling of security, distraction and the creation of a child-oriented environment. Topical analgesics are indicated for application to intact skin for surface anesthesia. For a safe use consideration must be given to the duration of application, the dose and the maximum area of skin treated in an age-dependent manner. For simple but painful procedures in premature infants, neonates and infants, pain can be effectively reduced by the oral administration of glucose. The positive effect is guaranteed particularly for the use in a once only pain stimulation. Non-nutritive sucking, swaddling, facilitated tucking and kangaroo mother care, for example can be used as supportive measures during slightly painful procedures. There is insufficient evidence for a pain reducing effect in older infants and small children. Physical therapeutic procedures can be used as accompanying measures for acute pain and are individually adapted. However, the limited amount of currently available data is insufficient to make a critical scientific assessment of the individual measures. The effects can, however, be observed in the daily routine practice. Psychological methods can facilitate coping with pain. In situations with mental and psychiatric comorbidities or psychosocial impairment, a psychologist should be consulted. Acupuncture and hypnosis are also a meaningful addition within the framework of multimodal pain therapy.},

To assess the clinical utility of 5 physical therapy (PT) outcome measures in quantifying functional changes in pediatric lower extremity chronic pain treated at a hospital-based interdisciplinary rehabilitation center.

DESIGN

This was a cross-sectional study with retrospective review of 173 individuals, 8 to 18 years old, treated from June 2008 to 2013.

METHODS

The measures used were the Timed Up and Go, Timed Up and Down Stairs, Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, 6-minute walk test, and Lower Extremity Functional Scale. Participant performance was correlated with demographic characteristics, the Functional Disability Index, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Child Depression Inventory, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure.

RESULTS

Scores from all 5 PT measures showed significant improvement following treatment. Functional Disability Index correlated to every PT measure except the 6-minute walk test.

CONCLUSIONS

This study supports the clinical use of these PT measures to track functional progress after rehabilitative treatment of lower extremity chronic pain-related disability.},

@article{Moncrieff.2004,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although there is a consensus that antidepressants are effective in depression, placebo effects are also thought to be substantial. Side effects of antidepressants may reveal the identity of medication to participants or investigators and thus may bias the results of conventional trials using inert placebos. Using an 'active' placebo which mimics some of the side effects of antidepressants may help to counteract this potential bias.

OBJECTIVES

To investigate the efficacy of antidepressants when compared with 'active' placebos.

SEARCH STRATEGY

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review groups's search strategy was used to search MEDLINE (1966-2000), PsychLIT (1980-2000) and EMBASE (1974-2000) and this was last done in July 2000. Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched and 12 specialist journals were handsearched up to 1996.

SELECTION CRITERIA

Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials comparing antidepressants with active placebos in people with depression.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Since many different outcome measures were used a standard measure of effect was calculated for each trial. A subgroup analysis of inpatient and outpatient trials was conducted. Two reviewers independently assessed whether each trial met inclusion criteria.

MAIN RESULTS

Nine studies involving 751 participants were included. Two of them produced effect sizes which showed a consistent and statistically significant difference in favour of the active drug. Combining all studies produced a pooled estimate of effect of 0.39 standard deviations (confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.54) in favour of the antidepressant measured by improvement in mood. There was high heterogeneity due to one strongly positive trial. Sensitivity analysis omitting this trial reduced the pooled effect to 0.17 (0.00 to 0.34). The pooled effect for inpatient and outpatient trials was highly sensitive to decisions about which combination of data was included but inpatient trials produced the lowest effects.

REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS

The more conservative estimates from the present analysis found that differences between antidepressants and active placebos were small. This suggests that unblinding effects may inflate the efficacy of antidepressants in trials using inert placebos. Further research into unblinding is warranted.},

@article{Nelson.2019,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Previous research has shown that youth with chronic pain who presented for a multidisciplinary evaluation report a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (eg, abuse, neglect, parent/guardian separation or divorce) at a high rate (over 80{\%}) and that those with pain and ACEs experience increased psychosocial impairment. Outside of chronic pain, evidence also suggests that youth with a history of ACEs experience poorer treatment outcomes. However, no study to date has examined treatment outcomes in youth with chronic pain and a history of ACEs. The current study aimed to examine the role of ACEs in multidisciplinary intensive pain rehabilitation treatment outcomes for youth with chronic pain.

METHODS

The sample included 305 youth who had undergone intensive pain rehabilitation. Outcomes examined included pain-related and psychosocial impairment measured at baseline and discharge from the program.

RESULTS

Results indicated that $\sim$59{\%} of this sample reported a history of ACEs with $\sim$21{\%} reporting a history of $\geq$2 ACEs. At baseline, youth with an ACEs history reported higher somatic symptoms. However, no significant interaction was found across treatment timepoints between ACEs history and time.

CONCLUSIONS

ACEs history was not a significant factor in treatment outcomes for youth with chronic pain who presented to intensive pain rehabilitation. However, the difference in report of ACEs history across treatment settings indicates that ACEs may be a barrier for youth to engage in recommended outpatient treatment before presenting to pain rehabilitation. Research is needed to further examine this phenomenon.},

Participants included 330 youth (89 children aged 7-11 years, 241 children aged 12-17 years) and their parents who participated in randomized controlled trials of family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic pain. Child pain and disability, parental emotional functioning, and parental responses to child pain were assessed at baseline and posttreatment.

RESULTS

The Protect and Monitor scales of the ARCS were sensitive to change following intervention for both developmental groups, with clinically meaningful reductions in these behaviors, thereby demonstrating responsiveness. Among the adolescent sample, greater change on some ARCS scales was associated with better parental emotional functioning and lower child pain at posttreatment.

Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that chronic pain in adolescence was associated with an increased likelihood of lifetime history of anxiety disorders (odds ratio: 1.33; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.09-1.63, P = 0.005) and depressive disorders (odds ratio: 1.38; confidence interval: 1.16-1.64, P {\textless} 0.001) reported in adulthood.

 abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES

To present psychometric data on a comprehensive, parent-report sleep screening instrument designed for school-aged children, the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). The CSHQ yields both a total score and eight subscale scores, reflecting key sleep domains that encompass the major medical and behavioral sleep disorders in this age group.

DESIGN

Cross-sectional survey.

SETTING

Three elementary schools in New England, a pediatric sleep disorders clinic in a children's teaching hospital.

PARTICIPANTS

Parents of 469 school-aged children, aged 4 through 10 years (community sample), and parents of 154 patients diagnosed with sleep disorders in a pediatric sleep clinic completed the CSHQ.

INTERVENTIONS

N/A.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS

The CSHQ showed adequate internal consistency for both the community sample (p=0.68) and the clinical sample (p=0.78); alpha coefficients for the various subscales of the CSHQ ranged from 0.36 (Parasomnias) to 0.70 (Bedtime Resistance) for the community sample, and from 0.56 (Parasomnias) to 0.93 (Sleep-Disordered Breathing) for the sleep clinic group. Test-retest reliability was acceptable (range 0.62 to 0.79). CSHQ individual items, as well as the subscale and total scores were able to consistently differentiate the community group from the sleep-disordered group, demonstrating validity. A cut-off total CSHQ score of 41 generated by analysis of the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) correctly yielded a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.72.

CONCLUSIONS

The CSHQ appears to be a useful sleep screening instrument to identify both behaviorally based and medically-based sleep problems in school-aged children.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Despite the availability of measures for assessing physical, psychological, and health impact in children with chronic pain, there are not established guidelines for interpretation of children's pain outcomes following psychological treatment. The purpose of this topical review is to discuss clinical significance as a neglected area of consideration in pediatric chronic pain assessment and to make recommendations on how the field can move toward benchmarking on core outcome domains.

METHOD

We review definitions of clinical significance and examples of several methodologies that have been used in other populations or are emerging in pediatric chronic pain including anchor-based methods, distribution-based methods, or multimethod approaches.

RESULTS

Few measures across pediatric chronic pain outcome domains have established clinical significance of scores to interpret meaningful change following treatment limiting the interpretability of findings from clinical trials. In the context of clinical practice, several efforts to examine clinical significance to improve the translation of evidence-based measurement into standard clinical decision-making exist.

CONCLUSIONS

Recommendations are provided to encourage additional validation efforts of outcome measures in pediatric chronic pain and to encourage authors to report clinical significance in clinical trials of psychological interventions for pediatric chronic pain.},

Appropriate outcome measures and high-quality intervention trials are critical to advancing care for children with chronic pain. Our aim was to update a core outcome set for pediatric chronic pain interventions. The first phase involved collecting providers', patients', and parents' perspectives about treatment of pediatric chronic pain to understand clinically meaningful outcomes to be routinely measured. The second phase was to reach consensus of mandatory and optional outcome domains following the OMERACT framework. A Modified Delphi study with two rounds was conducted including three stakeholder groups: children with chronic pain (n=93), their parents (n=90), and health care providers who treat youth with chronic pain (n=52). Quantitative and qualitative data from Round 1 of the Delphi study were summarized to identify important outcomes, which were condensed to a list of 10 outcome domains. Round 2 surveys were analyzed to determine the importance of the 10 domains and their relative ranking in each stakeholder group. A virtual consensus conference was held with the Steering committee to reach consensus on a set of recommended outcome domains for pediatric chronic pain clinical trials. It was determined, by unanimous vote, that Pain Severity, Pain Interference with Daily Living, Overall Well-being, and Adverse Events, including Death, would be considered Mandatory domains to be assessed in all trials of any type of intervention. Emotional Functioning, Physical Functioning, and Sleep were Important but optional domains. Last, the research agenda identifies several important emerging areas, including biomarkers. Future work includes selecting appropriate validated measures to assess each outcome domain.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pain catastrophizing is an important predictor of pain-related outcomes. Caregiver and child levels of catastrophizing about child chronic pain are associated cross-sectionally, yet predictive associations testing interpersonal influences within caregiver-child dyads are lacking. The present study tested caregiver and child influences on partner catastrophizing about child pain over a period of 1 month following initiation of interdisciplinary pain treatment and examined whether the change in pain catastrophizing was associated with child pain interference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 113 caregiver-child dyads (Mage=14.41) completed measures at the time of initiating care at a pediatric tertiary outpatient pain management clinic (baseline) and $\sim$1 month later. Caregivers and children independently reported on catastrophizing about child pain and child pain interference at baseline and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Caregiver and child pain catastrophizing decreased over 1 month following initial interdisciplinary pain evaluation, with average scores remaining in the moderate to high range. Change in caregiver, but not child, catastrophizing about child pain was predicted by partner baseline pain catastrophizing. Decreases in catastrophizing about child pain were associated with within-person improvement in ratings of child pain interference. DISCUSSION: In the short period following initial pain evaluation, caregivers and children evidenced reductions in pain catastrophizing, which were associated with increased child function. Findings highlight the important role of child cognitive-affective responses to pain in influencing caregiver catastrophizing about child pain. Understanding the individual contributions children and caregivers make to interpersonal pain processes will inform future family-level clinical interventions.},

@article{Peters.2008,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To present the contour-enhanced funnel plot as an aid to differentiating asymmetry due to publication bias from that due to other factors.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING

An enhancement to the usual funnel plot is proposed that allows the statistical significance of study estimates to be considered. Contour lines indicating conventional milestones in levels of statistical significance (e.g., {\textless}0.01, {\textless}0.05, {\textless}0.1) are added to funnel plots.

RESULTS

This contour overlay aids the interpretation of the funnel plot. For example, if studies appear to be missing in areas of statistical nonsignificance, then this adds credence to the possibility that the asymmetry is due to publication bias. Conversely, if the supposed missing studies are in areas of higher statistical significance, this would suggest the cause of the asymmetry may be more likely to be due to factors other than publication bias, such as variable study quality.

CONCLUSIONS

We believe this enhancement to funnel plots (i) is simple to implement, (ii) is widely applicable, (iii) greatly improves interpretability, and (iv) should be used routinely.},

@article{Pielech.2014,
 abstract = {The current study aimed to validate the child and parent pain catastrophizing scale in a large chronic pain sample and to identify child pain catastrophizing clinical reference points. Patients and parents (n=697) evaluated at a pediatric pain program completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, child (PCS-C) and parent (PCS-P) reports, along with additional measures of psychological functioning. The measure's psychometric properties were examined, as were relations across demographic, pain, and psychological characteristics and pain catastrophizing. Clinical reference points were identified for the PCS-C from differences in pain catastrophizing across levels of disability, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Overall, we did not find support for the hypothesized 3-dimension structure, and we recommend potentially removing items 7 and 8 for both the PCS-P and PCS-C as a result of floor/ceiling effects. The 11-item PCS-C is most parsimonious as a unitary construct, while the 11-item PCS-P comprises 2 factors. Although parent catastrophizing was significantly associated with child outcomes after controlling for pain level, it was no longer significant when accounting for child catastrophizing. When comparing PCS-C scores based on child outcomes, significant differences emerged for low, moderate, and high catastrophizing levels. It appears that the influence of parent catastrophizing on outcomes can be explained through its impact on child catastrophizing levels. PCS-C reference points derived from this large sample can aid clinicians in assessment and treatment planning, in turn increasing the utility of the PCS-C for both clinical and research purposes.},

 abstract = {Targeting parents' responses to their child's pain during intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) could influence child functioning. This longitudinal, observational study investigated changes in these responses and concurrent relationships between parent responses and changes in levels of child functioning and pain. Parents of youths 10 to 19 years of age (mean = 15 years, SD = 1.98 years) participated in twice weekly, parent-only groups while their teens were enrolled in IIPT (mean length of treatment = 3.93 weeks, SD = 1.16 weeks). Parent responses to child symptoms, as well as child pain and functional disability, were assessed weekly during treatment (n = 114) and at 3 follow-up visits: 1 month (n = 96), 6 months (n = 68), and 12 months (n = 45). Longitudinal multilevel modeling analyses indicated statistically significant decreases during treatment in parents' protective, monitoring, and minimizing responses and further improvement in all responses during follow-up. These changes were associated with concurrent changes in child disability. However, changes in parent behaviors occurred independently from changes in child pain levels. Baseline child characteristics affected neither baseline parent responses to pain nor changes over time. Results indicate that, in the context of IIPT, parental responses are amenable to change and that these changes may impact child pain-related functioning, providing further support for the role of parent-specific programming within IIPT. PERSPECTIVE: During intensive IIPT, parents made statistically significant changes in responses to their child's pain, which was associated with improvements in child disability, but not child pain. Changes were sustained through 1-year follow-up. Targeting parental responses to child pain is feasible and may relate to improved child functioning.},

@article{Pietschnig.2019,
 abstract = {Empirical sciences in general and psychological science in particular are plagued by replicability problems and biased published effect sizes. Although dissemination bias-related phenomena such as publication bias, time-lag bias, or visibility bias are well-known and have been intensively studied, another variant of effect distorting mechanisms, so-called decline effects, have not. Conceptually, decline effects are rooted in low initial (exploratory) study power due to strategic researcher behavior and can be expected to yield overproportional effect declines. Although decline effects have been documented in individual meta-analytic investigations, systematic evidence for decline effects in the psychological literature remains to date unavailable. Therefore, we present in this meta-meta-analysis a systematic investigation of the decline effect in intelligence research. In all, data from 22 meta-analyses comprising 36 meta-analytical and 1,391 primary effect sizes (N = 697,000+) that have been published in the journal Intelligence were included in our analyses. Two different analytic approaches showed consistent evidence for a higher prevalence of cross-temporal effect declines compared to effect increases, yielding a ratio of about 2:1. Moreover, effect declines were considerably stronger when referenced to the initial primary study within a meta-analysis, yielding about twice the magnitude of effect increases. Effect misestimations were more substantial when initial studies had smaller sample sizes and reported larger effects, thus indicating suboptimal initial study power as the main driver of effect misestimations in initial studies. Post hoc study power comparisons of initial versus subsequent studies were consistent with this interpretation, showing substantially lower initial study power of declining, than of increasing effects. Our findings add another facet to the ever accumulating evidence about non-trivial effect misestimations in the scientific literature. We therefore stress the necessity for more rigorous protocols when it comes to designing and conducting primary research as well as reporting findings in exploratory and replication studies. Increasing transparency in scientific processes such as data sharing, (exploratory) study preregistration, but also self- (or independent) replication preceding the publication of exploratory findings may be suitable approaches to strengthen the credibility of empirical research in general and psychological science in particular.},

 abstract = {Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) in children and adolescents is a serious medical condition, with considerable morbidity and few effective, evidence-based treatments. We performed a chart review of 83 adolescents (age range~=~13-18 years; 67 girls and 16 boys) diagnosed with CTTH. Two treatment protocols were compared: multimodal (osteopathic manipulative treatments, mindfulness, and qi gong) and pharmacologic (amitriptyline or gabapentin). Four outcomes (headache frequency, pain intensity, general health, and health interference) were assessed at three time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months). A fifth outcome, number of bilateral tender points, was recorded at baseline and 6 months. All five were evaluated statistically with a linear mixed model. Although both multimodal and pharmacologic treatments were effective for CTTH (time effects for all measures were significant at p~{\textless}~.001), results from each analysis favored multimodal treatment (the five group by time interaction effects were significant at or below the p~{\textless}~.001 level). Headache frequency in the pharmacologic group, for example, reduced from a monthly average (95{\%} Confidence Interval shown in parentheses) of 23.9 (21.8, 26.0) to 16.4 (14.3, 18.6) and in the multimodal group from 22.3 (20.1, 24.5) to 4.9 (2.6, 7.2) (a substantial group difference). Pain intensity (worst in the last 24 hours, 0-10 scale) was reduced in the pharmacologic group from 6.2 (5.6, 6.9) to 3.4 (2.7, 4.1) and from 6.1 (5.4, 6.8) to 2.0 (1.2, 2.7) in the multimodal group (a less substantial difference). Across the other three assessments, group differences were larger for general health and number of tender points and less so for pain restriction. Multimodal treatment for adolescent CTTH appears to be effective. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these promising results.},

@article{Randall.2018,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To provide a descriptive account of long-term functioning ($\geq$5 y posttreatment) among youth who completed intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) for pediatric chronic pain conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A total of 95 patients (mean age at follow-up=20.0 y) treated at least 5 years previously at a single IIPT program completed questionnaires assessing pain, functional disability, health care utilization, academic/career achievement, and quality of life. Data analyses focused on pain, functioning, and progress toward developmental goals at long-term follow-up.

RESULTS

The majority of respondents report significant reduction in pain compared with preadmission (P{\textless}0.001). Five years posttreatment, average functional disability scores were in the minimal range, with statistically significant decrease in functional disability from time of admission (P{\textless}0.001). Nearly 80{\%} of respondents characterized themselves as having no functional difficulties at follow-up. Clinically significant improvement was established for both pain and function. Respondents generally reported developmentally appropriate status, with 89{\%} graduating high school on schedule.

DISCUSSION

Results show long-term positive functioning among individuals who underwent intensive rehabilitation treatment for chronic pain as children or adolescents. Despite experiencing one or more pain flares at some point after treatment, most former IIPT patients report minimal to no ongoing functional disability, complete or partial resolution of pain symptoms, and developmentally appropriate progress toward goals (eg, school completion, independent living).},

@article{Randall.2021,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several factors are known to impact response to the intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program described in this study, yet no research has explored the role of perfectionism. This secondary data analysis explored direct and indirect relations between perfectionism and functional disability (primary outcome) and pain severity (secondary outcome) after IIPT, with pain catastrophizing and fear of pain as mediators. METHODS: Youth (N = 253) aged 8-21 with chronic pain and associated disability completed pre- and post-IIPT measures of self-oriented perfectionism (SOP), socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, functional disability, and pain characteristics for routine clinical care and this nonrandomized trial. Eight mediated models were run for the two predictors, two mediators, and two outcomes. RESULTS: Pretreatment perfectionism (SOP and SPP) led to greater reductions in pain catastrophizing over the course of IIPT, which resulted in lower pain severity (\textgreek{b} = -.02 [CI = -0.07, -0.01] for SOP and \textgreek{b} = -.02 [CI = -0.06, -0.003] for SPP) and less functional disability (\textgreek{b} = -.06 [CI = -0.13, -0.01] for SOP and \textgreek{b} = -.06 [CI = -0.14, -0.01] for SPP). Independent of pain catastrophizing, pretreatment SPP was directly associated with more posttreatment functional disability (\textgreek{b} = .16 [CI = 0.05, 0.27]). Fear of pain was not a mediator. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest perfectionism has the potential to negatively impact IIPT outcomes. However, when perfectionistic youth with chronic pain learn to manage pain-related distress, they benefit. Results highlight the importance of assessing for and treating perfectionism and pain-related distress in youth with chronic pain.},

Moreover, shrinkage in the hippocampus and the cerebellum accelerated with age. In the hippocampus, both linear and quadratic trends in incremental age-related shrinkage were limited to the hypertensive participants. Individual differences in shrinkage correlated across some regions, suggesting common causes. No sex differences in age trends except for the caudate were observed.

hypermobility in a small percentage of the pediatric population is well

described. However, literature discussing the treatment of chronic pain

associated with joint hypermobility in pediatrics is limited. The

present study examines the impact of interdisciplinary treatment on

chronic pain in pediatrics with joint hypermobility syndrome.

Objective: To determine if pediatric patients with chronic pain related

to joint hypermobility can be effectively treated with an intensive,

interdisciplinary pain management program, as measured by changes in

pain, psychosocial and physical functioning, as well as parental coping.

Design: Retrospective cohort study.

Setting: Urban academic tertiary intensive outpatient interdisciplinary

pain management clinic.

Participants: The study involved 30 patients who met the criteria for a

diagnosis of joint hypermobility and chronic pain and completed an

interdisciplinary pain management program.

Intervention: All patients were treated in an intensive pediatric

interdisciplinary pain management program for a duration of 6 to 8

weeks. The program provided physical therapy, occupational therapy,

psychological counseling, and weekly pediatric rehabilitation medicine

follow-up.

Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included numeric rating scale

pain scores, the Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire, and the Bath

Adolescent Pain-Parent Impact Questionnaire. Changes from pre- to

post-treatment were analyzed using paired-samples t tests.

Results: Patients endorsed pre- to post-treatment improvements in pain,

depression, general anxiety, pain-related anxiety, social functioning,

and physical functioning (P {\textless} .05). The patients' parents showed

significant improvements in depression, anxiety, catastrophic thinking,

self-blame and helplessness, leisure functioning, and parental behavior

(P {\textless} .05).

Conclusion: The present findings suggest that an intensive

interdisciplinary rehabilitation pain management program yields

short-term improvements in pain, emotional and physical function, and

daily activity in a pediatric population diagnosed with joint

hypermobility. Parents also experienced benefits from the program. A

larger prospective study with longer-term follow-up is needed.},

@article{Roessler.2016,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Chronic pain in children and adolescents has a major impact on their life in terms of school, sleep as well as family and social life. Teenagers aged 13-15 and girls are at the highest risk. Zeltzer et al. established a bio-psychosocial model of chronic pain in 1998 to account for all its dimensions and advocated a multidisciplinary management plan. Programs based on their principles target specific symptoms such as anxiety and loss of function, while treating underlying factors and teaching coping skills to patients and their families. They aim for patients to regain autonomy rather than focusing on pain resolution. Such programs, with varied protocols, have existed outside of France for approximately 15 years. The efficacy of these multidisciplinary programs has been shown in studies in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. To our knowledge, there are no French studies on this topic; therefore, our aim was to describe a French program. We hypothesized that the program would be effective in reducing chronic pain and its impact.

METHODS

The aim of this study was to describe the multidisciplinary management of chronic pain in a French pediatric functional rehabilitation center. It is a public health establishment located in the suburbs of Lille, offering care for children aged 0-18 with various conditions. It has 52 hospital beds, can accommodate up to 22 day-hospital visits per day and has comprehensive technical facilities. This prospective study consisted in a chart review of all consecutive patients who were hospitalized in the functional rehabilitation center for chronic pain with significant disability since 2010. We reviewed the treatment protocol for each patient as well as the treatment results for the composite primary endpoint, comprising pain characteristics and the impact of pain on function and schooling after discharge.

RESULTS

Twenty-nine patients, aged 9.4-17.8 years, 62.1{\%} of whom were girls, were hospitalized for chronic pain with a significant impact on their daily life between 2010 and August 2014. The most common diagnosis was complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) (37.9{\%}). Pain had major consequences, with total disability in 69{\%} of cases and 100{\%} of children taking pain medications. In 65.5{\%} of cases, patients were hospitalized in an inpatient setting, and 34.5{\%} attended an outpatient program. Treatment lasted from 1 to 68 weeks (mean, 24.3; standard deviation [SD], 21.6). Patients received a combination of medical care, physical therapy (100{\%}), occupational therapy (37.9{\%}), psychological counseling (100{\%}), pain medications (96.6{\%}), and schooling (96.6{\%}). Pain improved significantly in 89.7{\%} of patients (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] [0.73-0.98]) and pain medication consumption decreased significantly in 72.4{\%} of children (95{\%} CI [0.53-0.87]). Patients who had stopped walking could ambulate again in 91.7{\%} of cases (95{\%} CI [0.73-0.99]) and 86.4{\%} of patients who had been missing school were back at school full time (95{\%} CI [0.65-0.97]). There were no significant differences for these results between inpatient and outpatient management programs. Improvements were maintained at 3-6 months after discharge in 83.3{\%} of cases.

CONCLUSION

@article{Ruhe.2017,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

The aim of this study was to analyze changes in health care utilization and cost among a sample of highly impaired children and adolescents who sought a 3-week intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Claims data from 7 statutory health insurance companies were analyzed for 65 children and adolescents who sought IIPT at the German Paediatric Pain Centre. The annual health care utilization and cost were determined for the following 4 areas: outpatient care, inpatient care, medications, and remedies and aids. We analyzed the changes in resource utilization in the year before (pre{\_}1 y) IIPT and in the subsequent year (post{\_}1 y).

RESULTS

Within the first year after IIPT, overall health care costs did not decrease significantly. However, the pattern of health care utilization changed. First, significantly more children and adolescents started outpatient psychotherapy (P=0.001). Second, the number of hospitalized children decreased significantly from 1-year pre to 1-year post (P=0.001). Accordingly, there were significantly fewer hospitalizations for primary chronic pain disorders at 1-year post (P{\textless}0.001). The prescription of nonopioids, co-analgesics and opioids was significantly reduced from 1-year pre to 1-year post (all P{\textless}0.013).

DISCUSSION

The present results indicate that the health care costs of children and adolescents with severe chronic pain disorders do not significantly decrease 1 year after IIPT; however, the treatment becomes more goal-focused. Differential diagnosis measures and nonindicated therapeutic interventions decreased, and more indicated interventions, such as psychotherapy, were used. Future research is needed to investigate the economic long-term changes after IIPT.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a frequent and disabling health problem in children and adolescents and is associated with high health care utilization and costs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the direct and indirect costs of chronic pain in children and adolescents in monetary terms before and after multimodal pain therapy from a societal perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Health care costs 12 months before and after multimodal pain therapy include direct costs from statutory health insurances and parents as well as indirect costs due to working days lost. RESULTS: Direct median costs before multimodal treatment were 5619 {\text\euro} (min-max: 377-35,509 {\text\euro}) per year. In the year after pain therapy, costs decreased to a median of 3262 {\text\euro} (min-max: 142-42,910 {\text\euro}) (p = 0.001). In all, 55{\%} of patients showed a significant cost reduction, while 18{\%} had a cost increase. CONCLUSIONS: An effective multimodal pain therapy may reduce health care costs in children and adolescents. Further economic studies are needed to evaluate long-term effects of pain therapy for children and adolescents with chronic pain in a controlled design.},

For comparisons of 2 independent groups, a probability-based effect size estimator (A) that is equal to the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve and closely related to the popular Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistical tests has many appealing properties (e.g., easy to understand, robust to violations of parametric assumptions, insensitive to outliers). We performed a simulation study to compare 9 analytic and 3 empirical (bootstrap) methods for constructing a CI for A that can yield very different CIs for the same data. The experimental design crossed 6 factors to yield a total of 324 cells representing challenging but realistic data conditions. Results were examined using several criteria, with emphasis placed on the extent to which observed CI coverage probabilities approximated nominal levels. Based on the simulation study results, the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method is recommended for constructing a CI for the A statistic; bootstrap methods also provided the least biased and most accurate standard error of A. An empirical illustration examining score differences on a citation-based index of scholarly impact across faculty at low-ranked versus high-ranked research universities underscores the importance of choosing an appropriate CI method.},

Supporting families to effectively cope with their child's chronic pain is a critical need. This work analyzes intervention approaches from emerging treatment programs to support families coping with pediatric pain that diverge from traditional treatment models by specifically targeting parents. Two novel parent intervention programs are presented that consider caregiver needs in both outpatient and inpatient pain treatment settings: Parents as Coping Coaches and Putting Parents FIRST. These programs are evaluated through comparing parental training components across different stages of treatment. Additionally, the efficacy of Putting Parents FIRST in promoting maintenance of children's functional gains achieved in intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment is presented, and compared to previous results of the efficacy of Putting Parents FIRST. Specifically, outcomes of 36 children whose parents received the intervention in Putting Parents FIRST were compared to a matched control sample of children whose parents did not receive the parent intervention. Similar to the findings from Parents as Coping Coaches, results indicated that patients whose parents received the intervention maintained/improved program gains in disability, coping, and pain significantly more than patients whose parents did not receive the intervention. Implications for parent-focused intervention development efforts targeting parent and youth functioning in the context of pediatric chronic pain are considered.},

Clear communication of systematic review findings will help readers and decision makers. We built on previous work to develop an approach that improves the clarity of statements to convey findings and that draws on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING

We conducted workshops including 80 attendants and a survey of 110 producers and users of systematic reviews. We calculated acceptability of statements and revised the wording of those that were unacceptable to $\geq$40{\%} of participants.

RESULTS

Most participants agreed statements should be based on size of effect and certainty of evidence. Statements for low, moderate and high certainty evidence were acceptable to {\textgreater}60{\%}. Key guidance, for example, includes statements for high, moderate and low certainty for a large effect on intervention x as: x results in a large reduction$\ldots$; x likely results in a large reduction$\ldots$; x may result in a large reduction$\ldots$, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

Producers and users of systematic reviews found statements to communicate findings combining size and certainty of an effect acceptable. This article provides GRADE guidance and a wording template to formulate statements in systematic reviews and other decision tools.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a multimodal inpatient pain therapy for young adults with chronic pain. In addition, the change and influence of the autonomy development will be investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present longitudinal study examined the effectiveness of a 3-week multimodal inpatient pain treatment in young adults with chronic pain. Three-month follow-up data from 74 patients aged 18-25 years (75.7{\%} female) were included in the study. Standardized questionnaires were used to investigate pain characteristics, pain-associated and emotional impairments quality of life, and various facets of autonomy. RESULTS: The results show that pain-related and emotional impairments are significantly reduced after therapy. Furthermore, there is a significant improvement in the quality of life and resilience. The increased quality of life and reduced pain-related and emotional impairment are associated with a gain of autonomy convictions. DISCUSSION: Multimodal inpatient pain treatment seems to be effective during emerging adulthood. Autonomy convictions seem to be an important starting point for therapeutic success and have a modulating importance in terms of positive changes in emotional impairment and quality of live. Therefore, this aspect should be considered when pain treatment offers are developed for this age group.},

 abstract = {AIMS OF THE STUDY

Given the long history of underestimating chronic pain in children and adolescents, we lack valid data on its assessment and treatment. The psychological and economic burden for patients, their families and society is substantial. The aim of this study was to assess patient characteristics of the first ambulatory interdisciplinary clinic for children and adolescents with chronic pain in Switzerland and compare them with data from other international centres.

METHODS

All patients of the ambulatory interdisciplinary pain clinic at the University Children{\&}rsquo;s Hospital in Basel during the period from 4 January 2012 to 4 July 2016 were included in this retrospective study. Data were collected from the patients{\&}rsquo; medical records and from a questionnaire, which the patients and their parents received and completed in advance of their first visit. Demographic information, pain, referral, social environment, therapies and school absences of the patients were statistically analysed with means, percentages, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) and standard deviations (SDs).

RESULTS

Of the 135 patients included in this study, 80{\%} were female and the mean age of all patients was 13.95 years (95{\%} CI 13.5{\&}ndash;14.4). The commonest pain presentations were: musculoskeletal (38{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.30{\&}ndash;0.46), back (25{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.18{\&}ndash;0.33), multiple regions (21{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.15{\&}ndash;0.28) and headache (7{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.03{\&}ndash;0.12). Mean duration of pain until the patients came to the clinic was 24.5 months (95{\%} CI 19.82{\&}ndash;29.22). Physiotherapy (71{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.63{\&}ndash;0.79) and non-opioids (50{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.42{\&}ndash;0.59) were the most used therapies before the first meeting. Psychotherapy (52{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.44{\&}ndash;0.61), most often using a psychosomatic therapeutic approach (psychosomatic therapy) 34{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.26{\&}ndash;0.42), physiotherapy (36{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.27{\&}ndash;0.44) and non-opioids (33{\%}, 95{\%} CI 0.25{\&}ndash;0.42) afterwards. The mean number of school absences during the last month before the first visit was 5.1 days per month (95{\%} CI 3.48{\&}ndash;6.73). The parents of our study participants suffered more often from psychiatric diseases than the mean Swiss population.

CONCLUSIONS

The average of more than 2 years of pain before referral to the clinic seems to be a long time. Assuming that specialised support is mandatory for young patients with complex pain syndromes, the referral time should be reduced. Furthermore, patients with headache were underrepresented in Basel compared with other centres. Interestingly, in our study, patients{\&}rsquo; parents suffered more often from psychiatric diseases than the mean Swiss population.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To assess the short-term and 1-year outcomes of children with fibromyalgia treated with intensive physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT) and psychotherapy.

STUDY DESIGN

Children with fibromyalgia seen at a tertiary care hospital were treated with 5-6 hours of intensive PT/OT daily and at least 4 hours of psychosocial services weekly. All medications used for fibromyalgia were discontinued. Children underwent standardized testing, including a visual analog scale for pain; the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Performance, Second Edition; the Bruce treadmill protocol; the Functional Disability Inventory; the Pain Stages of Change Questionnaire, adolescent version; and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Teen Report, at 3 time points: at program entry, at the end of the intensive program, and 1 year after the end of the program.

RESULTS

Sixty-four children (median age, 16 years; 95{\%} Caucasian; 94{\%} female; median duration of symptoms, 21 months) were studied. The mean pain score decreased significantly from program entry to the end of the program (from 66 of 100 to 25 of 100; P = .001). At the 1-year follow-up, 33{\%} reported no pain. All measures of function on the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Performance, Second Edition improved significantly and remained at that level or continued to improve over the subsequent year. The mean Bruce treadmill protocol time first increased from 588 seconds to 801 seconds (P {\textless} .001) and then dropped to 750 seconds (P = .005), which is at the 90th percentile for age and sex. All Pain Stages of Change Questionnaire, adolescent version subset scores improved significantly initially and were stable or improved at 1 year, as did the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Teen Report total score.

CONCLUSION

Children with fibromyalgia can be successfully treated without medications with a very intensive PT/OT and psychotherapy program. They have significantly improved pain and function by subject report and objective measures of function.},

for assessing cardiovascular endurance in youth with chronic pain.

Materials and methods:Fifty-five youth with chronic pain completed the

the FTT were examined retrospectively using a clinical data registry.

Results:Participants' FTT time to exhaustion (TTE) improved by 1.5 min

after IIPT (95{\%} CI: 1.1-2.0 min), yet remained below age and

sex-matched norms. Construct validity was only supported by

performance-based assessments of physical function. Evidence of

discriminant validity was found, as the FTT was not correlated with

unrelated biopsychosocial constructs. Conclusions:Youth with chronic

pain present with significant deficits in cardiovascular endurance that

are not fully reversed after IIPT, highlighting the importance of

ongoing aerobic training after discharge. Findings support the FTT as a

valid, objective measure of cardiovascular endurance in youth with

This prospective study compared paternal versus maternal factors and their impact on child outcomes in the context of an intensive pediatric pain rehabilitation program.

Methods

One hundred four youth with treatment refractory chronic pain and their parents enrolled in an intensive pediatric pain rehabilitation program completed measures of pain, functional disability, and parent pain-related attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors at admission and discharge.

Results

Linear mixed models were used. Controlling for significant demographic and clinical characteristics, mothers and fathers who were present for the program typically demonstrated significantly better improvement from admission to discharge compared with nonpresent fathers. Mothers made the most significant gains in protective parent responses. Children also had significant decreases in pain and improvements in functioning over time.

Conclusions

Results indicate the efficacy of this treatment model for both children with chronic pain and their parents and highlights the importance of parental presence in treatment.},

@article{Simmonds.2005,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Meta-analyses based on individual patient data (IPD) are regarded as the gold standard for systematic reviews. However, the methods used for analysing and presenting results from IPD meta-analyses have received little discussion.

METHODS

We review 44 IPD meta-analyses published during the years 1999-2001. We summarize whether they obtained all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and how they examined the effects of covariates.

RESULTS

Twenty-four out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses (28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data from less than 80{\%} of the randomized patients sought, but did not address the resulting potential biases.

CONCLUSIONS

Although IPD meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects. In particular, IPD could be used to more fully investigate the influence of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of IPD meta-analysis.},

 abstract = {UNLABELLED

An important construct in understanding pain-related disability is pain-related fear. Heightened pain-related fear may result in behavioral avoidance leading to disuse, disability, and depression; whereas confrontation of avoided activities may result in a reduction of fear over time and reengagement with activities of daily living. Although there are several measures to assess pain-related fear among adults with chronic pain, none exist for children and adolescents. The aim of the current study was to develop a new tool to assess avoidance and fear of pain with pediatric chronic pain patients: the Fear of Pain Questionnaire, child report (FOPQ-C), and Fear of Pain Questionnaire, parent proxy report (FOPQ-P). After initial pilot testing, the FOPQ-C and FOPQ-P were administered to 299 youth with chronic pain and their parents at an initial multidisciplinary pain treatment evaluation. The FOPQ demonstrated very strong internal consistency of .92 for the child and parent versions. One-month stability estimates were acceptable and suggested responsivity to change. For construct validity, the FOPQ correlated with generalized anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and somatization. Evidence of criterion-related validity was found with significant associations for the FOPQ with pain, healthcare utilization, and functional disability. These results support the FOPQ as a psychometrically sound measure.

PERSPECTIVE

Pain-related fear plays an important role in relation to emotional distress and pain-related disability among children and adolescents with chronic pain. Identification of patients with high levels of fear avoidance of pain with the FOPQ will inform how to proceed with psychological and physical therapy interventions for chronic pain.},

Recent research has implicated pain-related fear in relation to functional outcomes in children with chronic pain. The current study examined fear of pain, disability, and depression within the context of an intensive pain rehabilitation program. One hundred forty-five children and adolescents who participated in an intensive interdisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation day program were assessed in this study. Patients completed measures of pain intensity, pain-related fears, functional disability, and depressive symptoms at admission, discharge, and on average, 2 months postdischarge. After controlling for pain intensity, pain-related fear was significantly related to disability and depressive symptoms at all time points. As predicted, a decline in pain-related fear was significantly associated with a decrease in disability and depressive symptoms. Interestingly, high levels of pain-related fears at admission predicted less reduction in functional disability and depression at discharge, suggesting that high levels of pain-related fear may be a risk factor in relation to treatment outcomes. Overall, results indicate that the relationship between fear of pain and changes in disability and depressive symptoms are closely linked, with fear of pain playing an important role in treatment.

PERSPECTIVE

This paper presents results underscoring the importance of pain-related fear in relation to treatment response for children and adolescents with chronic pain. These findings support the need to develop and implement interventions that target reductions in pain-related fear.},

Risk-stratified care is known to improve outcomes in adults with chronic pain. However, no tool exists to stratify youth who present with pain complaints to appropriate interventions. The Pediatric Pain Screening Tool (PPST) presented here assesses prognostic factors associated with adverse outcomes among youth and defines risk groups to inform efficient treatment decision making. Youth (n = 321, ages 8-18, 90.0{\%} Caucasian, 74.8{\%} female) presenting for multidisciplinary pain clinic evaluation at a tertiary care center participated. Of these, 195 (61.1{\%}) participated at 4-month follow-up. Participants completed the 9-item PPST in addition to measures of functional disability, pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity for the PPST ranged from adequate to excellent, with regard to significant disability (78{\%}, 68{\%}) and high emotional distress (81{\%}, 63{\%}). Participants were classified into low- (11{\%}), medium- (32{\%}), and high- (57{\%}) risk groups. Risk groups did not significantly differ by pain diagnosis, location, or duration. Only 2{\%} to 7{\%} of patients who met reference standard case status for disability and emotional distress at 4-month follow-up were classified as low risk at baseline, whereas 71{\%} to 79{\%} of patients who met reference standard case status at follow-up were classified as high risk at baseline. A 9-item screening tool identifying factors associated with adverse outcomes among youth who present with pain complaints seems valid and provides risk stratification that can potentially guide effective pain treatment recommendations in the clinic setting.},

All patients completed the PHODA-YE along with measures of emotional functioning and disability. Patients in the PPRC completed the measure at both admission and discharge. After eliminating infrequently endorsed and poorly loading items, factor analytic procedures yielded a 4-subscale, 50-item measure with strong internal consistency (from 0.92 to 0.97 across subscales). Fear, avoidance, and functional disability were strongly associated with PHODA-YE scores, supporting construct validity. Within the PPRC sample, PHODA-YE was sensitive to changes over time in relation to functional improvements. Across the PPRC sample, patients found it helpful to complete the PHODA and target feared activities.

 abstract = {Intensive pain rehabilitation programs for children with chronic pain are effective for many patients. However, characteristics associated with treatment response have not been well documented. In this article we report trajectories of pain and functional impairment in patients with chronic pain up to 1 year after intensive pain rehabilitation and examine baseline factors associated with treatment response. Patients (n = 253) with chronic pain and functional disability were assessed at 5 time points (admission, discharge, 1-month, 4-month, and 12-month follow-ups). Individual trajectories were empirically grouped using SAS PROC TRAJ. For functional disability, 2 groups emerged: treatment responders (88{\%}) and nonresponders (12{\%}). Using a binomial logistic regression model to predict disability trajectory group, no baseline variables were significant predictors for the disability trajectory group. For pain, 3 groups emerged: early treatment responders (35{\%}), late treatment responders (38{\%}), and nonresponders (27{\%}). Using multinomial regression analyses to predict pain trajectory group, older age, higher pain scores, fewer social difficulties, higher anxiety levels, and lower readiness to change were characteristics that distinguished nonresponders from responders; no significant predictors distinguished the late responders from the early responders. These results provide key information on the baseline factors that influence intensive pain rehabilitation outcomes, including risk factors that predict treatment nonresponse. Our findings have implications for developing more targeted treatment interventions.

Deriving groups of individuals with differing treatment response trajectories stimulates new thinking regarding potential mechanisms that may be driving these outcomes.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Sensory modulation patterns contribute to altered pain perception and disengagement in activities; atypical sensory modulation patterns have been associated with higher pain sensitivity, catastrophizing, and reduced function. Objectives of this study were to ascertain whether: adolescents with persistent pain had atypical sensory modulation patterns, atypical sensory modulation was associated with reduced functioning and higher pain, and pain catastrophizing mediated the relationship between sensory modulation and functional disability.

METHODS

Adolescents (N=70, females=63, males=7) attending tertiary level interdisciplinary team assessment for persistent pain completed sensory modulation (Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile), pain catastrophizing (Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire), pain intensity, functional disability (Functional Disability Index), and quality of life (QOL) (Pediatric QOL Scales) questionnaires.

RESULTS

Adolescents with persistent pain had atypical patterns of sensory modulation compared with normative data. Sensory modulation patterns were not associated with pain intensity; however, higher sensitivity was associated with greater disability (r=0.36, P{\textless}0.01), and lower registration of sensation was associated with poorer emotional (r=0.31, P{\textless}0.01), social (r=0.35, P{\textless}0.01), and school-related (r=0.49, P{\textless}0.001) QOL. Sensory modulation, pain intensity, and catastrophizing contributed independently to disability; catastrophizing mediated sensory sensitivity and both functional disability and emotional QOL.

DISCUSSION

Some barriers to obtaining this specialized care include a lack of availability of treatment centers, a perceived social stigma and individual barriers such as socioeconomic status. Specialized rehabilitation programs for severe disabling chronic pain worldwide have similarities regarding admission criteria, structure and therapeutic orientation. They differ, however, regarding their exclusion criteria and program descriptions. The short- and long-term effectiveness of some rehabilitation programs is well documented. All countries should promote the establishment of future pediatric pain centers to improve the health care of children and adolescents suffering from severe chronic pain. Standardized reporting guidelines should be developed to describe treatments and outcomes to enable comparability across treatment centers.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Interdisciplinary pain treatment has been shown to be effective for children and adolescents with chronic pain, both in an outpatient and inpatient setting. Until now, the effectiveness has been analyzed with various outcome measures. Although it has only rarely been used for adolescents so far, Chronic Pain Grading (CPG) developed by Von Korff could be an appropriate general outcome measure.

OBJECTIVE

The study aims at prospectively investigating and comparing the therapy outcome one year after initial presentation for both outpatients and inpatients using the CPG.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data of 258 adolescents were gathered at initial presentation and one year later and analyzed using the CPG. Changes from pretreatment to follow-up and predictors of good therapy outcome were investigated for the whole sample and separately for outpatients and inpatients.

RESULTS

Compared to inpatients, outpatients were characterized by a~lower CPG both before and one year after initial presentation. Large effects were found both for outpatient and inpatient therapy regarding the improvement of the CPG. In outpatient therapy, boys were two times more likely to display therapy success.

CONCLUSION

The study shows that the CPG is an appropriate outcome measure to display the long-term effectiveness of an inpatient and outpatient interdisciplinary pain treatment. The interdisciplinary pain treatment needs to be better tailored to girls to improve its effectiveness.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Although treatment satisfaction is recommended in the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (PedIMMPACT) as a core outcome measure in pediatric chronic pain clinical trials, no results regarding this outcome measure have been reported to date for intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment in children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to close this gap and investigate the treatment satisfaction of pediatric patients with different chronic pain disorders who received intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment and who were followed up over 4 years.

METHODS

Treatment satisfaction and treatment outcome were assessed immediately after and 6, 12, and 48 months after intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment for N=104 patients (Mage=13.5; SD=2.2).

RESULTS

Patients and their parents were highly satisfied with the treatment and strongly agreed in their ratings. Emotional distress before treatment and younger age increased the risk of being dissatisfied. Analyses revealed that treatment satisfaction was independent of treatment outcome.

DISCUSSION

Taken together, the results show that treatment satisfaction is not associated with treatment outcome. A global judgment of satisfaction seems to be an independent outcome measure but may be inappropriate for measuring the multifaceted construct of satisfaction. Instead, separate satisfaction ratings in specific areas, for example, treatment methods or outcome, may be more suitable.},

 abstract = {AIM: We characterize the pediatric postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) population seen at a single tertiary care referral center. METHOD: Retrospective chart review of all pediatric POTS patients seen in our center between 2015 and 2017. Pediatric POTS was defined as chronic, at least 3 months, symptoms of orthostatic intolerance associated with excessive orthostatic tachycardia as determined by tilt table testing with orthostatic heart rate increment of $\geq$40 bpm within 5 minutes of head-up tilt or absolute orthostatic heart rate $\geq$130 bpm for patients 13 years old and younger and $\geq$120 bpm for those 14 years and older. We looked at demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, examination findings, investigation findings, treatment, and patient reported outcomes. Outcome measures were separated by patient report and group comparisons were made using 2-sample t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients with pediatric onset POTS were identified. The mean age was 15 years. Seventy-nine percent of patients were female and 90{\%} were white. The most common presenting symptoms included dizziness/lightheadedness (88{\%}), syncope (54{\%}), and palpitations (40{\%}). Many patients had significant comorbidities attributable to numerous bodily systems, most commonly headache syndromes (migraine 43{\%}, nonspecific headache 22{\%}, chronic daily headache 14{\%}, and new daily persistent headache 5{\%}) and chronic fatigue (60{\%}). Low vitamin D and insufficient iron stores were commonly seen. The majority of patients improved or had resolution of symptoms following treatment (70{\%}). When separated by outcome, statistically significant differences were found for glucose (patients whose symptoms resolved had higher median glucose), palpitations (patients whose symptoms resolved were less likely to have palpitations), constipation (patients whose symptoms were stable/worsened were more likely to have constipation), and unexplained pain (patients whose symptoms were stable/worsened were more likely to have unexplained pain). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric POTS is a chronic condition with a fairly good prognosis following appropriate treatment. It is associated with numerous comorbidities that necessitate multidisciplinary expert care.},

 abstract = {Among youth with chronic pain, elevated somatic symptoms across multiple body systems have been associated with greater emotional distress and functional disability and could represent poor adaptation to pain. The Children's Somatic Symptoms Inventory (formerly the Children's Somatization Inventory) is commonly used to assess somatic symptoms in children. However, no studies have evaluated the clinical usefulness of the measure in the assessment of pediatric patients with chronic pain. This study evaluated the factor structure and clinical relevance of the 24-item Children's Somatic Symptoms Inventory (CSSI-24) in youth (n = 1,150) with mixed chronic pain complaints presenting to a tertiary pain clinic. The CSSI-24 total scores were equal or superior to factor scores as indicators of patients' clinical characteristics (functional disability, pain catastrophizing, fear of pain, and anxiety and depressive symptoms) and parental catastrophizing and protective responses. Tertile-derived clinical reference points for the CSSI-24 total score ({\textless} 18, low; 19-31, moderate; {\textgreater}= 32, high) significantly differed on measures of clinical characteristics and parent factors. Controlling for age, sex, pain intensity, and primary pain complaint, the high somatic symptoms group exhibited significantly greater health care use compared with the moderate and low groups. The assessment of somatic symptoms in pediatric patients with chronic pain may provide useful information regarding patients' psychosocial risk and tendency to access health services. Perspective: Clinical reference points based on the CSSI-24 total scores meaningfully differentiated youth with chronic pain on measures of emotional distress, functioning, parent catastrophizing and protective responses, and health care use. Assessing somatic symptoms could provide useful information regarding a pediatric patient's psychosocial risk, tendency to access health services, and need for enhanced care coordination.

 abstract = {Background The parent's role in the context of pediatric chronic pain is essential. There is growing evidence that parent psychological flexibility positively impacts child functioning. To assess parents' abilities to respond with psychological flexibility to their child's pain, the Parent Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire (PPFQ) was developed. Here, we aim to validate the 10-item version of the questionnaire in an English-speaking population and to evaluate associations with parent behaviour, child pain acceptance and functioning. Methods Five hundred and seventy-eight parent-child dyads presenting at a pediatric pain clinic were included (92{\%} mothers, average child age 15.2 +/- 1.6 years). The PPFQ was completed by the parent. Parent and child also completed other standardized questionnaires. In addition to confirmatory factor analysis and assessments of reliability and validity of the PPFQ-10, a mediation analysis was performed to examine the direct and indirect effects of parent psychological flexibility on child functioning. Results Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model with subscales for Values-Based Action, Pain Willingness and Emotional Acceptance, and the PPFQ-10 demonstrated strong psychometric properties. After controlling for child pain, parent psychological flexibility indirectly affected child functioning through its association with both parent behaviour (i.e., protectiveness) and child pain acceptance. Conclusions Our findings provide further support for use of the PPFQ-10 and the importance of assessing and addressing parent psychological flexibility in the context of child chronic pain. Our data show that parent psychological flexibility has an important adaptive role and can impact child functioning through two different routes, both of which can be actively targeted in treatment. Significance Our findings demonstrate that the PPFQ-10 is an efficient measure of parent psychological flexibility, demonstrating strong psychometric properties. Furthermore, our analyses showed that parent psychological flexibility indirectly affects child functioning through associations with both adaptive parent behaviour and child functioning. Taken together, this study furthers the understanding of how parent psychological flexibility operates and affects children with chronic pain, and may inform and optimize treatments aimed at improving functioning by addressing child and parent coping.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) (Children's Hospital and Health Center, San Diego, California) is a modular instrument for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL Disease-Specific Modules. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 items applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions.

METHODS

The 4 PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (Physical, Emotional, Social, School) were administered to 963 children and 1,629 parents (1,677 subjects accrued overall) recruited from pediatric health care settings. Item-level and scale-level measurement properties were computed.

RESULTS

Internal consistency reliability for the Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.88 child, 0.90 parent report), Physical Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.80 child, 0.88 parent), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.83 child, 0.86 parent) were acceptable for group comparisons. Validity was demonstrated using the known-groups method, correlations with indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and factor analysis. The PedsQL distinguished between healthy children and pediatric patients with acute or chronic health conditions, was related to indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and displayed a factor-derived solution largely consistent with the a priori conceptually-derived scales.

CONCLUSION

The results demonstrate the reliability and validity of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales may be applicable in clinical trials, research, clinical practice, school health settings, and community populations.},

Therefore, considering the multifactorial nature of chronic pain, these patients should be treated with a multidisciplinary, balanced approach that seeks a primary outcome of improved functioning rather than of pain reduction. Using a bio-psycho-social approach, a multidisciplinary team, including a physiotherapist, nurse, social worker, psychologist, and physician, has been effective in achieving this outcome of improved functioning in children and adolescents with chronic pain. In this review, we discuss the impact, associated conditions, and evolution of chronic pain, along with the crucial role of every member of a multidisciplinary chronic pain clinic involved in the care of the children and adolescents with chronic non-cancer pain.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Interventional procedures are part of multidisciplinary pain treatment programs to treat chronic non-cancer pain conditions in children and adolescents. However, the real benefit of these interventions remains unclear.

AIMS

The aim of this study was to analyze the potential benefits of the interventional procedures in children and adolescents with chronic non-cancer pain in the setting of a multidisciplinary pain treatment program.

METHODS

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 98 children and adolescents receiving 314 diagnostic or therapeutic interventional procedures. We applied the following definitions of efficacy Short-term positive therapeutic effect: block that produced a minimum of 50{\%} reduction in pain intensity for at least 4~weeks. Long-term positive therapeutic effect: a patient with a minimum of 50{\%} reduction in pain intensity for at least 6~months Full recovery: a patient free of pain, not taking analgesics with normal physical and role functioning 6~months after the last procedure.

RESULTS

Seventy-six of 112 diagnostic blocks (68{\%}) were associated with a 50{\%} reduction in pain intensity for at least 4~weeks after the procedure. One hundred and sixty-six of 202 therapeutics blocks (82{\%}) were associated with a short-term benefit. Seventy-two of 98 patients (73{\%}) referred a 50{\%} reduction in their pain intensity (17{\%}) or had full recovery 6~months after the procedures (56{\%}) and a MPTP. Psychiatric comorbidity and more advanced age were factors associated with failure to respond to interventional procedures.

CONCLUSION

The use of interventional procedures may represent a valid therapeutic option, associated with positive clinical outcomes within a multidisciplinary program.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE

Stepped wedge trials (SWTs) are a type of cluster-randomized trial that are commonly used to evaluate health care interventions. Most SWT-related software packages have restrictive assumptions about the study design and correlation structure of the data. The objective of this paper is to present a package and corresponding web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that provide researchers with another, more flexible option for SWT design and analysis.

METHODS

We developed an R package swCRTdesign ('stepped wedge Cluster Randomized Trial design'), which uses a random effects model to account for correlation in the data induced by a SWT design. Possible sources of correlation include clusters, time within clusters, and treatment within clusters.

RESULTS

swCRTdesign allows a user to calculate power, simulate SWT data to streamline simulation studies (e.g. to estimate power), and create descriptive summaries and plots. Additionally, a GUI, developed using shiny, is available to calculate power and create power curves and design plots.

CONCLUSIONS

The swCRTdesign package accommodates a wide variety of SWT designs, and makes it easy to account for some sources of correlation which are not found in other packages. The user-friendly web-based GUI makes some swCRTdesign features accessible to researchers not familiar with R. These two resources will make appropriately complex SWT calculations more accessible to scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds.},

This study tested the effectiveness of a new acceptance and commitment therapy -based pain management intervention, using physical and psychological functions as the outcomes. The objective was also to determine whether Pediatric Pain Screening Tool risk profiles function as outcome moderator in the current sample. A valid screening tool would enable the program development. Methods Thirty-two consecutive adolescent patients (13-17 years old) with idiopathic recurrent musculoskeletal pain completed the study. The intervention comprised acceptance and commitment therapy-oriented multidisciplinary treatment. Pediatric Pain Screening Tool, pain frequency, functional disability, school attendance, physical endurance, depressive symptoms, and catastrophizing coping style were measured before treatment (baseline) and again at 6 and 12 months after the initiation of treatment. To test the effectiveness of the new program, we also determined whether the original risk classification of each patient remained constant during the intervention. Results The intervention was effective for high-risk patients. In particular, the pain frequency decreased, and psychosocial measures improved. In post-intervention, the original risk classification of seven patients in the high-risk category changed to medium-risk. PPST classification acted as a moderator of the outcome of the current program. Conclusions The categorization highlighted the need to modify the program content for the medium-risk patients. The categorization is a good tool to screen adolescent patients with pain. Implications The results support using the Pediatric Pain Screening Tool in developing rehabilitation program for pediatric musculoskeletal pain patients. According to the result, for adolescent prolonged musculoskeletal pain patients the use of ACT-based intervention program is warranted.},

@article{Wager.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The chronic pain grading (CPG), a standard approach to classify the severity of pain conditions in adults, combines the characteristics of pain intensity and pain-related disability. However, in children and adolescents, the CPG has only been validated in a school sample, but not in the actual target population, i.e., clinical populations with pain.

METHODS

In the present study, we applied the CPG to a tertiary sample of adolescents with chronic pain (n=1242). Construct validity, sensitivity to change and prognostic utility were examined.

RESULTS

Results indicate that most adolescents were equally classified into the three higher severity grades. Higher CPG classification was associated with more pain locations, higher pain frequency, longer pain duration, extensive use of health care and more depressive symptoms. Adolescents with a high CPG received recommendations for inpatient treatment more often; however, the prognostic utility for therapy recommendation - as operationalized in this study - was low. Sensitivity to change was assessed via reassessment at follow-up for a subsample of 490 adolescents. The majority of adolescents improved to a less severe CPG; changes were more common in the high severity range.

CONCLUSION

The CPG may be applied to adolescent tertiary care samples and to assess outcomes in clinical trials. However, in this study it was not appropriate to assign adolescent patients to different treatment options. Future work should focus on developing a comprehensive assessment tool for assigning patients to different treatments.},

@article{Wager.2020b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Chronic pain is a common issue in adolescents. Prevalence of pain and associated factors present differently in sex and age subgroups; however, the interaction of sex and age combined has not been thoroughly assessed. This study aimed to identify psychosocial and health factors associated with chronic pain in younger and older adolescent girls and boys.

METHODS

Students from five schools in grades 5-10 self-completed a pain survey. Participants were 2,280 adolescents (52{\%} girls) aged 10-18~years (M~=~12.95, SD~=~1.84). Data were analysed using multivariate logistic regression models.

RESULTS

Chronic pain was present in 33{\%} of participants. The risk of chronic pain increased by 29{\%} in girls, compared to 16{\%} in boys, per year of age (p~=~.039). Overall, depression (OR~=~2.05, p~{\textless}~.001), anxiety (OR~=~1.51, p~{\textless}~.001), lower school satisfaction (OR~=~1.41, p~=~.034) and sleep issues (OR~=~2.34, p~{\textless}~.001) were associated with chronic pain. Stratified analyses identified unique significant associations between chronic pain and psychosocial factors. In boys aged 10-13~years, higher socioeconomic status (OR~=~1.76, p~=~.024) and poorer school performance (OR~=~1.60, p~=~.027) were uniquely important; in girls aged 10-13~years, lower school satisfaction (OR~=~2.92, p~=~.003) was associated with pain, and in older girls aged 14-18~years, anxiety (OR~=~1.74, p~=~.009) was significantly associated with pain. When these differences were assessed statistically, only lower school satisfaction had significant differences between subgroups (p~=~.049).

CONCLUSIONS

Many psychosocial and health factors are similarly important, with few differences, for chronic pain in girls and boys at different stages of adolescence.

SIGNIFICANCE

We report evidence that negative psychosocial and health factors are related to a higher prevalence of chronic pain in adolescents. Furthermore, the relationships between anxiety, socioeconomic status, lower school satisfaction and lower school performance with pain may vary between adolescents of differing sexes and ages. Understanding how possible risk factors for chronic pain contribute differently to the pain experience of adolescent girls and boys is an important step towards lowering the prevalence of this common health condition.},

@article{Wager.2021,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Findings on the short- and long-term effectiveness of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) for children with severe chronic functional pain are promising. However, a definitive appraisal of long-term effectiveness cannot be made due to a lack of comparison groups. The aim of the present study was to compare the health status of former patients with the health status of an age- and sex-matched comparison group from the community. METHODS: Data from two samples, a clinical sample of former patients (n = 162; aged 14 to 26) and an age- and sex-matched community sample (n = 162), were analysed. Former patients provided data 7 years after IIPT. Pain characteristics, physical and mental health status, autonomy, coping and health care utilisation were compared between the two samples. RESULTS: Seven years after treatment, the majority (58{\%}) of the clinical sample were completely pain-free. Compared to the community sample, the clinical sample demonstrated worse physical and mental health and continued to seek more frequent health care, irrespective of whether or not they experienced ongoing chronic pain. However, the clinical sample reported better coping strategies and a comparable level of autonomy. CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing severe chronic pain in childhood who engage in IIPT are likely to have recovered from their pain in early adulthood. Long-term treatment effects may manifest in better coping strategies. However, reduced mental and physical health status may indicate a negative long-term effect of early chronic pain experiences or a general vulnerability in people developing a chronic pain condition in childhood. SIGNIFICANCE: The majority of severely impaired paediatric chronic pain patients no longer suffer from chronic pain seven years after intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment. However, former patients have worse physical and mental health status than a community sample, and continue to seek out more frequent health care utilisation, irrespective of whether or not they continue to experience chronic pain. Therefore, potential negative long-term effects of childhood chronic pain experiences need specific attention early on.},

To conduct a multimethod psychometric evaluation to refine the Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI) and to investigate its dimensionality.

METHOD

The CSI was administered to 876 pediatric patients with chronic abdominal pain at their initial visit to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Tools from three psychometric models identified items that most effectively measured the construct of somatization and examined its dimensionality.

RESULTS

Eleven statistically weak items were identified and removed, creating a 24-item CSI (CSI-24). The CSI-24 showed good psychometrics according to the three measurement models and correlated .99 with the original CSI. The CSI-24 has one dominant general factor but is not strictly unidimensional.

CONCLUSIONS

The CSI-24 is a reliable and psychometrically sound refinement of the original CSI. Findings are consistent with the view that somatization has a strong general factor that represents a continuum of symptom reporting, as well as minor components that represent specific symptom clusters in youth with chronic abdominal pain.},

@article{Westendorp.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) is a widely used instrument for measuring health-related quality of life covering both the physical and psychosocial domain. This study examined the responsiveness of the Dutch CHQ 50-item Parent Form (PF50) in a sample of adolescents with chronic non-specific pain and/or fatigue.

METHOD

Five different methods were used to calculate the responsiveness for the physical (PhS) and psychosocial (PsS) subscale of the CHQ-50: standardized response mean (SRM), pooled effect sizes (ESs), standard error of measurement of agreement (SEMagreement ), minimal detectable change (MDC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For data analysis, the population was divided into two groups based on the parent's global perceived effect of treatment: a changed group (A) and an unchanged group (B).

RESULTS

The responsiveness analyses were performed including 92 adolescents (88.0{\%} girls; mean age 16.4 years). The SRMs are 2.89 and 1.01 for the PhS and PsS, respectively. Large ESs are found for group A (PhS = 3.30; PsS = 1.16). The method used for calculating SEMagreement results in a score of PhS = 18.92 and PsS = 11.39. The MDCs of PhS and PsS are 52.45 and 31.57, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for PhS = 0.79 and for PsS = 0.64, and the corresponding optimal cut-off points are 21.1 and 7.0.

CONCLUSION

Using the methods SRM, ES and AUC, the responsiveness of the CHQ-PF50 in adolescents with non-specific chronic pain or fatigue treated in a rehabilitation clinic is adequate for the physical scale and moderate for the psychosocial scale.},

@article{Westendorp.2017,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

The aims of this study were, first, to determine the percentage of adolescents with chronic pain/fatigue successfully treated with rehabilitation treatment for chronic pain/fatigue and, second, to identify predictors for a successful rehabilitation treatment.

METHODS

Treatment success is scored based on a combination of predefined clinically relevant changes in 4 outcome measures: level of pain/fatigue, school absence, physical functioning, and psychosocial functioning. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis with treatment success as a dependent variable is performed to identify predictors for successful treatment.

RESULTS

A total of 172 adolescents (mean age 16.2 [SD = 2.5]; 85.5{\%} girls) participated. Almost half (49.6{\%}) of the adolescents had a successful treatment. The explained variance for the complete model explaining treatment success was 49{\%} (R2 = 0.487). Patients with a higher level of pain/fatigue and a passive coping style pretreatment improved most, and these factors could thus be indicated as predictors for successful treatment. Also, gender significantly contributed to the prediction, in favor of boys.

CONCLUSIONS

Regarding the first aim, using predefined treatment success based on clinically relevant changes, half of the participants had a successful treatment. Concerning the second aim, adolescents with a high level of pain/fatigue and those with a high passive coping style pretreatment have a better ability to change their functioning during treatment.

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Evidence for the effectiveness of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) for pediatric chronic pain is growing; however, little research has considered factors that contribute to differences in patients' treatment response. The present study utilized multilevel modeling to examine trajectory of change over time in functional disability from clinic assessment to 6-month follow-up in pediatric patients participating in IIPT, considering spatial distribution of pain, coping efficacy, and pain intensity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants included 110 pediatric patients (Mage=14.65, SD=2.37; localized pain, 27.3{\%}; widespread pain, 72.7{\%}) consecutively admitted into IIPT. Patients completed self-report measures of functional disability, pain intensity, and coping efficacy at pretreatment assessment, admission, weekly during IIPT, discharge, and several follow-ups.

RESULTS

Analysis identified a model with 3 three-way interactions, including time, time squared, pain intensity, coping efficacy, and pain distribution, on functional disability. The spatial distribution of pain had the greatest impact on treatment trajectory in patients with widespread pain, high pain intensity, and poor coping efficacy; these patients demonstrated greater functional disability compared with patients with localized pain. In addition, patients with widespread pain and poor coping efficacy had the most functional disability across all levels of pain intensity. Patients with localized pain and poor coping efficacy demonstrated initial treatment gains, but evidenced an increase in functional disability at follow-up.

DISCUSSION

Overall, spatial distribution of pain, coping efficacy, and pain intensity played an important role in patients' response to treatment. Better understanding of these variables could improve treatment response, particularly for the most severely disabled chronic pain patients.},

@article{Wilson.2012,
 abstract = {UNLABELLED

Physical functioning is often impaired in adolescents with chronic pain, which has largely been demonstrated through subjective self-report measures. Actigraphy uses motion monitoring as an objective means for assessing one dimension of physical functioning; physical activity level. This study used subjective and objective measures to assess multiple dimensions of physical functioning in a clinical sample of adolescents with chronic pain (n = 78) and a comparison group of healthy adolescents (n = 59). Individual and pain characteristics were also examined as predictors of actigraphy variables within the chronic pain sample. Results indicated that adolescents with chronic pain demonstrate significant impairment in subjective measures of physical functioning and evidence lower levels of physical activity. Actigraphic measures of physical activity were moderately correlated with self-report measures of physical functioning. Individual characteristics, including adolescent age, sex, and Body Mass Index percentile, were associated with physical activity levels among adolescents with chronic pain. Physical activity represents a distinct dimension of physical functioning. Assessing physical activity may provide additional description of physical functioning among adolescents with chronic pain, and may help identify targets for intervention in this population.

PERSPECTIVE

This study demonstrates that adolescents with chronic pain have lower physical activity levels, as measured objectively via actigraphy, as well as poorer subjective reports of physical functioning, compared to healthy adolescents. Actigraphic measurement of physical activity provides objective source data about one dimension of physical functioning.},

A cross-sectional comparison was made of the distribution of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in groups of 41 male and 43 female long distance runners versus larger control groups matched for age and sex, randomly selected from northern California towns. The runners showed modestly lower total cholesterol concentrations, while their triglyceride levels were only 50{\%} of control. HDL-cholesterol was higher in runners than controls (75 +/- 14 vs 56 +/- 14 mg/100 ml for women; 64 +/- 13 vs 43 +/- 10 for men), while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower (113 +/- 33 vs 124 +/- 34 for women; 125 +/- 21 vs 139 +/- 32 for men). All differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05), and only partially attributable to known factors other than high physical activity level. Since the runners were predominantly normotensive, relatively lean, and exclusively nonsmokers, they appear to constitute a remarkably favored group with respect to risk of cardiovascular disease.},

@article{Yoon.2019,
 abstract = {Background: As a complex multidimensional construct, fatigue may play an important role in the physical and psychosocial functioning of youth with chronic pain. Based on a model previously tested in adults, the current study similarly utilized patient-reported outcomes measurement system (PROMIS) to examine how fatigue contributes to functional outcomes for youth with chronic pain. The model tested self-reported ratings of pain intensity, depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance as predictors of outcomes (mobility, pain-related interference and school functioning) as mediated by ratings of fatigue. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-five youth with chronic pain ages 8-17 years and their caregivers, completed surveys as part of their initial clinical evaluation at a tertiary paediatric pain clinic. Study measures included: paediatric PROMIS domains (mobility, pain interference, sleep disturbance, fatigue and depressive symptoms), Paediatric Quality of Life school functioning and pain intensity. All mediated effects were calculated via a 1,000-draw bootstrap estimation method in Mplus. Results: Fatigue was found to be a statistically significant mediator of the effects of pain intensity, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms on outcomes of pain interference, mobility and school functioning. While pain intensity was found to independently contribute to mobility and pain interference, depressive symptoms did not show significant effects on any outcome beyond its association with fatigue. Sleep disturbance predicted pain interference while fatigue predicted school functioning. Conclusions: Findings suggest that fatigue is an important intervening factor for functional outcomes among youth with chronic pain. Targeting fatigue may be effective in optimizing school functioning and reducing the deleterious effects of depressive symptoms. Significance: This cross-sectional study highlights fatigue as a potential clinical target by applying a path analytic model to understand its possible significance and distinction from overlapping constructs such as pain intensity, depression and sleep disturbance. Further study of fatigue may be important in understanding its importance in treatment of paediatric chronic pain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Prevalence of pain as a recurrent symptom in children is known to be high, but little is known about children with high impairment from chronic pain seeking specialized treatment. The purpose of this study was the precise description of children with high impairment from chronic pain referred to the German Paediatric Pain Centre over a 5-year period.

METHODS

Demographic variables, pain characteristics and psychometric measures were assessed at the first evaluation. Subgroup analysis for sex, age and pain location was conducted and multivariate logistic regression applied to identify parameters associated with extremely high impairment.

RESULTS

The retrospective study consisted of 2249 children assessed at the first evaluation. Tension type headache (48{\%}), migraine (43{\%}) and functional abdominal pain (11{\%}) were the most common diagnoses with a high rate of co-occurrence; 18{\%} had some form of musculoskeletal pain disease. Irrespective of pain location, chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors was diagnosed frequently (43{\%}). 55{\%} of the children suffered from more than one distinct pain diagnosis. Clinically significant depression and general anxiety scores were expressed by 24{\%} and 19{\%} of the patients, respectively. Girls over the age of 13 were more likely to seek tertiary treatment compared to boys. Nearly half of children suffered from daily or constant pain with a mean pain value of 6/10. Extremely high pain-related impairment, operationalized as a comprehensive measure of pain duration, frequency, intensity, pain-related school absence and disability, was associated with older age, multiple locations of pain, increased depression and prior hospital stays. 43{\%} of the children taking analgesics had no indication for pharmacological treatment.

CONCLUSION

Children with chronic pain are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as they often have two or more different pain diagnoses, are prone to misuse of analgesics and are severely impaired. They are at increased risk for developmental stagnation. Adequate treatment and referral are essential to interrupt progression of the chronic pain process into adulthood.},

@article{Zernikow.2018,
 abstract = {Objective

Disabling pediatric chronic pain is accompanied by a significant burden to those affected and by high societal costs. Furthermore, it bears the risk of aggravation into adulthood. Studies have shown intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment to result in short-term positive effects on pain-related and psychological outcomes. In this study, we aimed to prove the stability of the long-term effects of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment four years after treatment.

Methods

This longitudinal observational study followed adolescents who had received intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment over four years. We defined a combined end point, overall improvement (pain intensity, pain-related disability, and school/work absence), and investigated three additional psychological outcome domains (anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing). We also examined changes to economic parameters (health care utilization, subjective financial burden) and their relationship to patient improvement.

Results

Similar patterns were observed for pain-related and psychological outcome domains, with data showing statistically and clinically significant reductions from admission to four-year follow-up. These positive effects were stable from one- to four-year follow-up. Approximately 60{\%} of the adolescents showed an overall long-term improvement. Older age was found to be a risk factor for treatment failure. Economic parameters decreased statistically significantly, particularly for those with an overall improvement of the chronic pain disorder.

Conclusions

The results of this study support the long-term effectiveness of intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment and indicate that it can interrupt pain chronification. Future research is warranted to investigate why some of the adolescents did not show improvement and to allow for a more individualized treatment.},

The present study extends the findings of previous studies and provides further reasons for discontinuing the use of preliminary tests. The study found Type I error rates of a two-stage procedure, consisting of a preliminary Levene test on samples of different sizes with unequal variances, followed by either a Student pooled-variances t test or a Welch separate-variances t test. Simulations disclosed that the twostage procedure fails to protect the significance level and usually makes the situation worse. Earlier studies have shown that preliminary tests often adversely affect the size of the test, and also that the Welch test is superior to the t test when variances are unequal. The present simulations reveal that changes in Type I error rates are greater when sample sizes are smaller, when the difference in variances is slight rather than extreme, and when the significance level is more stringent. Furthermore, the validity of the Welch test deteriorates if it is used only on those occasions where a preliminary test indicates it is needed. Optimum protection is assured by using a separate-variances test unconditionally whenever sample sizes are unequal.},
