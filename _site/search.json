      "contents": "\r\nThis website contains all treatment characteristics we identified through our literature search for our systematic review and meta-analysis regarding Intensive Interdisciplinary Pain Treatment for children and adolescents (Claus et al. 2021).\r\nThe idea of this website is to publish the results of the qualitative analysis of our paper (i.e., the description of available treatments) so that clinicians can see which IIPT components were identifiable based on published journal articles for which treatment site. If the treatment components identified through our research are out of date or incomplete, clinicians can get in touch with us and we’ll update the treatment components for that specific site based on credible sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaus, Benedikt B., Lorin Stahlschmidt, Emma Dunford, János Major, Cynthia Harbeck-Weber, Rashmi P.
